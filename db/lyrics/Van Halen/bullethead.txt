My karma just ran over your dogma.
I can feel your pain.
If everything is coming your way
you're facing the wrong lane.

Bullethead,
bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead
got a different kind of truth
Bullethead,
yes you are in danger.
I drive just like you!

How many roads must a man walk down
before he admits he's lost.
And do you really, really drive this way
just to piss me off?

Boldly going nowhere,
trouble busting through.
Yeah, I'm rolling slowly
but I'm ahead of you.

Bullethead,
bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead
got a different kind of truth
Bullethead,
yes you are in danger.
I drive just like you!

Well I'm a lovin' the horn baby.
Well I'm a bullethead.
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come on baby
Well I'm a bullethead.

Hurt me!

Traffic is giving you trouble?
I can feel your pain.
No light at the end of the tunnel
due to budget constraints.

Some days you're the dog,
some days you're the hydrant.
If everything is going your way
you're facing the wrong lane.

Bullethead,
bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead
got a different kind of truth
Bullethead,
yes you are in danger.
I drive just like you!
