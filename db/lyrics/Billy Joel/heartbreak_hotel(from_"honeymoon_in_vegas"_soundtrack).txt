Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
Heartbreak Hotel

I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

And although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
Where broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they been so long on lonely street
They're never comin' back

I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Hey now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel

You get so lonely, baby
You get so lonesome
You get so lonesome, you could die

Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For those broken hearted lovers
Cry away the blues

Get so lonely, baby
Get so lonely
They get so lonely, I could die

I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die
