I got a baby that's oh so pretty
I found her right here in the Windy City
Somebody kissed my baby last night
My pretty baby cried, you know it wasn't right

Diddley Diddley daddy
Diddley Diddley daddy

My baby started to cry in vain
Say Bo Diddley, you know you're a natural born man
I say I love you baby with all my heart
Please don't never say we'll part

Diddley Diddley daddy
Diddley Diddley daddy

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley here's our scene
I want to know if you do love me
