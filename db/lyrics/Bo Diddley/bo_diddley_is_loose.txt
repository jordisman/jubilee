Am Slack Daddy, ain't my real name
I'm the captain, boy, I'm the man
I wrote diddley daddy too
I even wrote folk in the tent for you

Hey daddle dee dum dum
Hey daddle dee dum dum
Ee dum dum dee dum dee dum
Ee dum de dum dum dee dum dee dee

Diddley walked diddley just about him
I saw a purety thing and I just couldn't quit
Staring at a darling out in the street
I hollered "Hey, hey Bo Diddley
Hey, Bo Diddley
Hey, Bo Diddley"

She said, "Hey boss man, you better hush your mouth
Before you grill me, take a look at yourself"
I said "Hey hey hey hey hey"
I said "Dee dum de dum dee dum dum"
I hollered "Dee dum de dum dee dum dum
Dee dum ah dum dee dum dum"

Altogether
Altogether
Altogether
Altogether
Altogether, yeah yeah

Dearest darling out on the street
Hollered "Hey, hey Bo Diddley"
Said "Hey, hey Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley
Hey hey hey hey hey"
