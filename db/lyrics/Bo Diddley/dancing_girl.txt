Runnin' for the dance hall
Lightnin' speed
Lookin' for my baby
Wonder was she dead?

Run on the stage
Gotta do my dance
What a minute, baby
Won't you give me a chance?

Jumped on the stage
And started jumpin' around
Couple more lessons
And I'll have it down

Get back, baby
And wait for yo' turn
This dance a-take
A lotta time to learn

Left foot out
And the right one behind
Couple more lessons
You'll have it on style

Dance all night
Dance all day
Stay up little girl
Wouldn't let me get away

Run out the dance hall
I was goin' around the world
Tried to get away
From that dancin' girl

Holler, Bo Diddley, wait for me
I was so tired, I couldn't see
