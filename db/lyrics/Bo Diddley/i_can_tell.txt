I can tell because it's plain to see
I can tell the way you look at me
The way you know, you hold my hand
Yes, pretty baby I can understand
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

No more, no more
No more, a-no more
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

I asked your mama and your papa, too
What more can a poor man do?
Now, you been runnin' with a heart-breaker child, around
Yes, a new boy's why you put me down
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

Well, you won't answer your telephone
When I knock on your door
They say that you ain't home
Your sister let me in
And tell me I can wait

When you come home
You show up real late

Now, I can tell
Oh, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

No more
I said, no more
No more
No more

Baby, I can give you romance
Only if you give me another chance
I'll cook your food and wash your clothes
I promise I'll keep your warm when it get cold

I can tell
I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

No more
No more
A-no more
