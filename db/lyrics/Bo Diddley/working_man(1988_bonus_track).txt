Well, I work on the railroad
With a sledge in one hand and a pick in the other
Well, I can do more work than my brother
Work don't hurt me
Well, I look over yonder and what I see
The ol' water boy a'comin' up to me
Sometimes he be running
And then again he be jumping
Oh, you oughta hear my sledgehammer pumpin'
Well, I wanna tell you and I'm-a tell you time and again
It was a terrible wind
It was my sledgehammer
I'm a man amongst men
Work for a little bitty pay
Sweat running off every way
Oh, I'm a working man
