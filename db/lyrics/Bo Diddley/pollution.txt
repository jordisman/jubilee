Now, jet planes line up in the sky
Pretty soon, we all gonna die
Some of you people don't understand
About throwin' your garbage in the street and use your can

About throwin' your garbage in the street and use your can

(We got to stop pollution)
Say it, chump, watch that paper bag
(We got to stop pollution)
Put the top on that garbage can, baby
(We got to stop pollution)
The wind is blowin' awfully hard
(We got to stop pollution)
Watch that cigarette pack, baby
(We got to stop pollution)
Me and you, baby
(We got to stop pollution)
We got to keep America clean, honey
(We got to stop pollution)
You and me
(We got to stop pollution)
