I was driving home on the boulevard late one night
When I spied a guy over on the corner, bumming all alone
Now, as I passed him by I heard him holler out, "Hey!"
I slowed down, see what he said, he hollers out
"By any chance are you going my way?"
I say, "Why sho' baby, hop on in an' gimme a cigarette"
Just then he reached down in his pockets
And that was the moment I regret

He hollered, "Reach for the sky"
I said, "But I don't understand, sir"
"Don't try no monkey business
I've got a stopper in my hand"

And then he says, "A-looka-here, you see this here I got in my hand
This is a .38 pistol, built on a .45 frame
Shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain"
He said, "Now, I am not trying to shake you up"
(And I), "But I just want you to know
If the cops start to crowd me any
You going to be the first to go
So, now looka-here, don't even look back
You just drive on just like isn't nothing happening"
That's what he told me
He wouldn't even let me look back at nothing

He say, "When I get to that red light"
He wanted me to go to my left and then jump back to my right
He says, "Now-a, I want you to drive up in that alley
Uh-uh, not in that alley, that, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door"
That's what he told me

He say, "Keep my foot on the gas and always be on guard"
Because when he come running out there with all that money
He wanted me to mash on it real hard
He said, "Now, don't let him come out over there
And find me a double-cross"
Because he'd murder when the heat's on

"Reach for the sky"
I said, "But I don't understand, sir"
"Don't try no monkey business
I've got a stopper in my hand"

Ooh-we, while I was sitting there just rambling
A spotlight hit me dead in the face
The cop pulled up behind me and said
"Move up a little bit, man, for we want to take your place"
And then this guy come running out of the store
With the money in his hand and said, "Oh, there you are!"
Ha, he made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car
When they put the handcuffs on him
I said, "Child, you crime have outgrew him"
And then they said, "Yeah, we going to' put him so far back in jail this time
Until they going to have to pump air into him"
