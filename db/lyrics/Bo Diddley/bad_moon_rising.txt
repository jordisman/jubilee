I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earth quakes and lightning
I see the bad times today

Don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear the rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye you taken for an eye

Don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
