I don't want no Cadillac
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
One I got, I'm gonna take it back
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Come out the house, early in the mornin'
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Both flat tires, didn't give me no warnin'
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Ooh, ooh, Cadillac

Looked in the trunk, there wasn't no jack
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
You know I'm gonna take this Cadillac back
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Willie an-a Lillie come a-walkin' up the street
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Doin' a little wiggle, makin' fun of me
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Ooh, ooh, Cadillac

(Yeah)

Come to the car but the car wouldn't start
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Cadillac is breakin' my heart
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Got it started, pulled in empty on drive
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Keys to believe in natural lies
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
(Ooh, ooh) Cadillac

(Yeah-ay)
