You can't change me, baby
Try to copy my ways
I'm tired of you trying to do what I do
You better do what I say

I went out last night
And I'm going back out again
If you tip out that door
You better beat me in

I get up in the morning
Go out and do my work
You look at me like I'm going crazy
But I ain't nobody's jerk

I'm going out tonight
As soon as I get off
And if you ain't home when I get there
I'm going to show you who's boss

You better do what I say
