It seems as though I've lived my life on the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs and sitting still without a rusty spoon
Come on people, live with me where light has never shone
And the harlots flock like humming birds speakin' in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life

Ain't no use for watchdogs here to justify my ways
We live our lives in manacles, the main 'cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds my sentence come to soon
Why should I be made to pay on the bad side of the moon

I'm a light world away from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life
