I met a girl from Hong Kong
I met a girl from Hong Kong
She don't sound like what she said she's from
She said she's from - Hong Kong
You know that teacher, beware she's from
She's from Hong Kong, Mississippi

That little girl, I figured Hong Kong be
I mean maybe, Chinese beans
She said I followed there, where she lived
I saw her struggling, a-climbing stairs
Where's she from, someone like one
I know she's from Hong Kong, Mississippi

You all know me, Lord

She whispered in my sweet little ear
She said Bo Diddley, um yeah I said
Help me baby, baby where you from
She said I'm from a place they call Hong Kong
I said you don't sound like where you from
I know you from Hong Kong, Mississippi

Mississippi, ooh
Mississippi, ooh
Mississippi
Mississippi
Mississippi, oh yeah

I saw you the other day in front of where you live
I've seen you struggling in a cotton field
Picking brand new Chinese beans
You started waving, waving at me
Tell me baby, tell me where you from
I know you from Hong Kong, Mississippi
