You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden
You be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no

Cleopatra had her way
Matahari did too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no you know it
This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

No, no
You know it

I'll be the garden
You be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no
You know it

No, no
You know it
