I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help?
Far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush rush rush on you
Love love loved on you
Love you like a fool
Put my trust in you

'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

'Cause I'm just me
That's all I can be
Something real
Something I can feel
You know I just can't change
This is how I'm made
I'm not afraid
Take me to the place

'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should wait

You're on me I don't think you should wait
You're on me, one pull up away
You're down to ride
Ride me like a wave
I gave you a sensation
Loner days you used to chase
It's do or die and my love life can't get crazy
It's on the line girl you're risking everything
It's over ex rated

Ran so far to try to find the thing I lacked and there it was inside of me
Ran and ran and ran so fast a thing to last and there it was I hear you breathe

'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Say come come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous

My cravings get dangerous
I don't think we should play with this

My cravings get dangerous
I don't think we should wait

It's on the line girl you're risking everything
