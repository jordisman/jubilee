Mistakes I know I've made them and you don't know how much I hate them
But that's me darlin' and I don't guess ol' Jerry will ever change
And I don't mean to hurt you heaven knows I hate to hurt you
But here I am to ask forgiveness one more time
One more time I'll ask you to forgive me one more time I'll come crawling back to you
All I ask is a chance to show how much I love you so
Will you please take me back one more time

Oh one more time I'm gonna tell you that I'm sorry
But this time darlin' I'll go down on my bended knee
And I'll cry and beg forgiveness please won't give me your forgiveness
Will you please take me back one more time
Won't you please take me back just one more time
