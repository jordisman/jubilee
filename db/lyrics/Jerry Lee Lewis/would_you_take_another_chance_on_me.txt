If I promise you to straighten up and put my life in order
If I swear to you woman on bended knees I won't hurt you again
If I become the kind of man that you want me to be
Would you take another chance on me
The good Lord knows I've done you wrong I've asked him to forgive me
Deep inside I think you would darlin' if you could do the same
If I could take back all the things that caused you misery
Would you take another chance on me
Would you take another chance on me I've paid for my mistakes
Would you take another chance on me or have I changed too late
Mhm I've been a fool woman for hurting you but can't you see I'm sorry
If only you were mine again I'd make it up to you
But my past keeps blindin' you if you could only see
Would you take another chance on me (think about that darling)
