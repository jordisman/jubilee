Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
Walkin? thirty miles in route to Bombay.
To meet a brown eyed handsome man,
Brown eyed handsome man
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man,
Brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
Back ever since the world began
there's been a whole lot of shakin? goin? on
Over brown eyed handsome man,
Brown eyed handsome man
Piano-/Guitar solo
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man,
Brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count had nobody on
He hit a high fly in the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
Brown eyed handsome man, Yeah!
