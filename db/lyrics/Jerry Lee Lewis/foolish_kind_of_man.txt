Can I cast the shadow of your mem'ry from the past
And dreams about the love we shared of that couldn't last
But as times goes on I won't give up to have you back again
I guess I'm just a foolish kind of man
Foolish kind of man that's what they tell me
I wonder about the love you never gave me
If you would only stop and think about the love that was true
Then you'll know how much darlin' I have to offer you

Can I stop this feeling in my heart that hurts me so
Can I erase the memory of your gentle touch
Darlin' I won't stop my love for you even if i can
I guess I'm just a foolish kind of man
Foolish kind of man that's what they tell me
I wonder about the love you never gave me
If you would only stop and think about the love that was true
Then you'll know how much darlin' I have to offer you
Then you'll know how much darlin' I have to offer you
