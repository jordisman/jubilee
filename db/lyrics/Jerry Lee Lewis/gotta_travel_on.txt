I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on

Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home no Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
'Cause he's been on this chain gang too long

I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on

High sheriff and police ridin' after me
Ridin' after me yes they're comin' after me
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on

Want to see my honey want to see her bad
Want to see her bad oh want to see her bad
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had

I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
