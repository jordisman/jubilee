Search the corners of your precious heart and if you find something there
And there's anyway to call it love and we still got a prayer
I've got more love for you sweetheart than you'll ever find again
So before you close that door on me think about it darlin'
Think about it darlin' give yourself a little time
Consider all you mean to me and you might change your mind
Mhm I haven't been the kind of man you wanted me to be
But if you stay'll darlin' I'll try to change. don't give up on Jerry Lee
Lord things were good between us once I know they could be again 
And there's nothing good about goodbye think about it darlin'
(There's nothing good about goodbye) think about it darlin'
