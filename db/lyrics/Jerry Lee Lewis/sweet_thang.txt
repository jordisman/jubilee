Well I slipped out of the house about sundown
While mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say

Well has anybody here see my sweet thang?
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
Cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom roses
If my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes

Well I gave my baby all my money on payday
Except a little she don't know that I've got
Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
She seems to like me quite a lot
While we were sittin' in the back booth a havin' a talk
She believed in every thing I said
When the door blew open and mamma walked in
Shoutin' loud enough to wake the dead

Well has anybody here see my sweet thang?
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
Cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom roses
That if my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes
