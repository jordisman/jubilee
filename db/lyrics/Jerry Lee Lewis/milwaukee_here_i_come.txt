Well I'm gonna get on the ol' turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town till you decide
Which one do you want the most them opera stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee

We were watchin' TV Ernest Tubb was singin' loud
I said that's the man for me I love him there's no doubt
I'm leavin' you right now to go and find out where he's at
But if I can't get him I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt

Well I'm gonna get on that ol' turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm a gonna leave this town till you decide
Which one do you want the most George Jones or Jerry Lee
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee

Well I'm goin' now and trade my ol' Ford for a nose
I might get all drunked up and trade it for the rose
There's just one thing I know I'll always be true
Cause there ain't no way to get drunk honey to stop my lovin' you

Babe I'm a gonna get on that ol' turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm a gonna leave this town till you decide
Which one do you want the most George Jones or Jerry Lee
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee

Well I'm a gonna get on that ol' turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm a gonna leave this town till you decide
Which one do you want the most George Jones or rockin' Jerry Lee
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee
Whoa Milwaukee here I come from Nashville Tennessee
