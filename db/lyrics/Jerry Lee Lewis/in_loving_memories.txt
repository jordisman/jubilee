I stand here so solemn with a blank look on my face
As you lay there dressed in white lace
With my head bowed ow Lord the tears are streaming down
I can hear that old preacher man say

In loving memories we gather
In loving memories on this sad day
In loving memories forever
Until we meet beyond the shining river

Pretty flowers I'll plant around you
And a white fence will surround you
And on your marker words of love I'll inscribe
And though in death we're apart
You know you'll always be in my heart
And it won't be long till I'll be by your side

In loving memories we gather
In loving memories on this sad day
In loving memories forever
Until we meet beyond the shining river
