I had a home out in Texas out where the Bluebonnet grew
I had the kindest mother how happy we were just we two
Till one day the angels called her it's the debt that we all have to pay
She'd call me close to her bedside these last few words she did say
Now son don't start drinking or gambling promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting that promise I've broke I must say
I started drinking for past time at last Lord I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money never dreaming that I'd ever fall
One night I've bet all my money nothing was left to be seen
All that I needed to break them was one card and that was a Queen
Cards were delt all round the table each man took a card from the draw
But I drew the one that would beat them I turned it here's what I saw
I saw mama's picture somehow she seemed to say
Son you have broken your promise I tossed those cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy cause I knew I was wrong from the start
And I'll never forget that promise to mother the Queen of my heart
