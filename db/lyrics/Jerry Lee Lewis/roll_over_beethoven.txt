Well I'm a write a little letter gonna mail it to my local DJ
Yes it's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's risin' and a jukebox blowin' a fuse
My heart's a beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps a singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rockin' arthritis sittin' down at a rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven they're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel you like it go get your lover then reel and rock it
With one another then move on up just a trifle further
Move and groove with one another
Roll over Beethoven dig these rhythm and blues yeah yeah

Yeah it's early in the morning and I'm giving you my warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle I'm a playin' my fiddle and I ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy little partner you oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she's got a dime the music won't ever stop
Roll over Beethoven roll over Beethoven roll over Beethoven...
