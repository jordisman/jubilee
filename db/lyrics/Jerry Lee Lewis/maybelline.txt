Maybelline why can't you be true oh Maybelline why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill I saw Maybelline in a Coupe de Ville
Cadillac rollin' on an open road but nothin' outrun my V8 Ford
Cadillac doin' about ninety-five bumper to bumper rollin' side to side
Maybelline why can't you be true...

Well the Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water poured up under my motor hood
I knew that were doin' my motor good
Maybelline why can't you be true...

Well the motor cooled down the heat went down and
And that's when I heard that highway sound
Cadillac lookin' like a ton of lead a hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill
Maybelline why can't you be true...
Oh Maybelline Maybelline Maybelline Maybelline...
