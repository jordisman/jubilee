If you've lost a love that you can't live without it seems
And your world has taken on a darker shade
And you spend your days and nights in total loneliness
There's a miracle magic liquid called foolaid

It'll cure what ails you as the old sayin' goes
It'll numb your brain and ease your pain from your head down to your toes
It'll make you forget a while all the mistakes you've ever made
This miracle magic liquid called foolaid

The victims of this liquid crutch are the ones who never smiled
But when life goes wrong though it don't last long it helps a little while
But to pay the price a sacrifice of your self-respect is made
To gain the strength that comes each day from foolaid

It'll cure what ails you as that old sayin' goes
This miracle magic liquid called foolaid
