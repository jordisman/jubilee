(Pen and paper won't you tell me what to write)

Pen, paper can't you tell me what to write
I don't know I can't think I'd been here half a night
I don't want to hurt her but I love somebody new
Pen, paper help me tell her we're through

Shall I say, dear used to be forget me
Shall I say dear broken heart we'll have to part
When she reads about my new love will she cry
Pen (pen) paper (paper) is that a way to say goodbye

Now I've just wrong another hour on the floor
I'll start again yes I trouble write some more
Shall I find sincerely yours
Pen (pen) paper (paper)

paper, I came
