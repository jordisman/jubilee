You know I can be found sittin' home all alone
If you can't come around a least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Baby if I made you mad for somethin' I might have said
Please let's forget the past the future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel I got a heart so true
I don't want no other love honey it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Let's walk up to the preacher and let us say I do
Then you gonna have me baby I got a little bitty your love too
And don't don't don't don't be cruel
I don't want no other love honey it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Hey don't stop thinkin' about me and don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me you know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Well I don't want no other love honey it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart I really love you baby cross my heart
