Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
Then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me...

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
All the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

I've got to gather my senses together (Gather)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now)
Be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me
