Well I swear, I didn't see you with your wife's best girlfriend
Drinkin' beer and a dancin' to that western swing
And I didn't see you kiss her and leave that barroom with her
No I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

George, I know I didn't hear you tell that blonde that you weren't married, no
I know I didn't see you hidin' your weddin' ring either did I?
And I know I couldn't have heard you call your wife
And tell her that you were working
No, no I didn't see you, I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

We've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
Now don't forget Ray I was down in Atlanta
Sure you were and I was workin' late
Yeah you know it's always good to see you
George it's good to see you too, yeah
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

Hey Ray by the way do you leave that hundred bucks you owe me
I don't know what you're talkin' about George
Well I'm sure you recall our bet on last night's football game
No I don't but you know if I had seen you, I certainly would've paid ya
But I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing

We've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
Don't forget I was down in Atlanta
And don't you forget I was working late
Oh you know it's always good to see you
George it's good to see you too
But I, I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
I didn't see you and I didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
