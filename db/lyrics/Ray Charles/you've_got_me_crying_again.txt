You got me cryin' again
You got me cryin' again
What is this love all about
I'm in and then I'm out

Your kisses right from the start
They came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then
Somebody new looks good to you
You got me cryin' again, just cryin' for you

Your kisses right from the start
They came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then
Somebody new looks good to you
You got me cryin' again, just cryin' for you
