Cherry, Cherry, ain't in a shame
That you can't be sweet as your name
Always flirtin', havin' your fun (having your fun)
Never sayin' if I'm the one (if I'm the one)

But if I am, I'll hang around
Till you grow up and settle down
Oh will you (Cherry) while your heart's on a spree
Cherry, save your loving for me
(Cherry, I'll get you yet)

Cherry (Cherry) I say Cherry
Woah, I'll make a bet
Oh, Cherry, Cherry
I'll get you yet
