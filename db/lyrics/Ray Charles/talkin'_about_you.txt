Who is my friend, when all friends are gone
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Who is my friend, when all friends are gone
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Who is my friend, when all friends are gone
You always defend me, if I'm right or wrong
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Talkin' 'bout you

Knows how to love me, in my way
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Knows how to love me, in my way
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Knows how to love me, in my way
Who's always there, every night and day
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Talkin' 'bout you

Who is the sugar in my tea
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Who is the sugar in my tea
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Who is the sugar in my tea
When I'm in trouble, who sees by me
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Talkin' 'bout you

Knows how to love me, in my way
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Knows how to love me, in my way
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Knows how to love me, in my way
Always there, every night and day
I'm talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you
Talkin' 'bout you, I do mean you

Talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Talkin' 'bout you, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Talkin' 'bout you
