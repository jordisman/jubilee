Feudin' and fussin' and a-fightin,'
Sometimes it gets to be excitin', now
Don't like them ornery neighbors down by the creek
We'll be plumb out of neighbors next week

Grandma, poor ol' grandma
Tell me, why'd they have to shoot poor grandma
She lies in the clover
You see, someone caught her bending over
Pickin' up a daisy!

Feduin' and fussin' and a-fightin'
There is a wrong that needs a rightin'
Let's get that funeral service over
So then we can start in a-feudin' again

Daughter, baby daughter
Poisened all the neighbors chickens
Daughter hadn't oughter
Least 'till she could run like the dickens
They hit her with a shovel

Feudin' and fightin' and a-fussin'
No use a-standin' here a-cussin', now
Let's give our daughter a pistol now that she's four
And go feudin' and fightin' some more
