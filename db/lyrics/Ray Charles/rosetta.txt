Rosetta, my Rossetta 
In my heart dear there's no one but you

You told me that you loved me
Never leave me for somebody new
You made my whole life a dream
And I pray you make it come true

Rosetta, my Rosetta
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you

Rosetta, woah Rosetta
In my heart dear there's no one but you

You told me that you loved me
Never leave me for somebody new
You made my whole life a dream
And I pray you make it come true

Rosetta, woah Rosetta
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you
