The stars at night are big and bright,
Deep In the Heart of Texas

The Prairie Sky, is Wide and High,
Deep In the Heart of Texas

The Sage in bloom is like perfume,
Deep in the Heart of Texas

Reminds me of the one I love,
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The Coyotes wail along the trail,
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The rabbits rush around the brush
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The cowboys cry, "Ki-yip-pee Yi"
Deep in the Heart of Texas

The Dogies bawl, and bawl and bawl
Deep In the Heart of Texas
