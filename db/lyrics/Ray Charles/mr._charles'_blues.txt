Baby we went last winter
And the ground was covered with snow
Yes we went last winter baby
And the ground was covered with snow
Oh now, I didn't have no money in my pocket darling
Shouted I didn't have no place to go

Well it seems like I was going crazy sometime
I didn't know what to do
Yes it seems like I was going crazy sometime
Baby I didn't know what to do
Yeah, I wake up in the morning
Shout and laid down with the blues

Well I finally got a break baby
Yes and things are coming my way
Yeah, I finally got a break baby
Yes and things are coming my way
I've got money in my pocket darling
Yes I can change clothes everyday
