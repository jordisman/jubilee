If you're ever in a jam, here I am
And if you're ever in a mess, S.O.S
And if you ever feel so happy
You land in jail. I'm your bail

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be hot

If you're ever up a tree, just phone to me
If you ever loose your teeth when you're out to dine, borrow mine

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be great

If they ever black you're eyes, put me wise
Well, if they ever cook your goose, then turn me loose
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, I'll complain

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are soon forgot
Ours will still be it

If you're ever down a well, ring my bell
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh

It's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick
