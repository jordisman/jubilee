My little Margie
I'm always thinking of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you so
So don't forget your promise to me
I have bought a home and ring and everything

For Margie
You are my inspiration
Days are never blue
After all is said and done
There is really only one
And Margie, Margie it's you

After all is said and done
There is really only one
And Margie, 
Oh Margie, 
Margie it's you, you, you
