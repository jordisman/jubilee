She must be someone now who's all alone now
Say, I want a little girl, yeah, to fall in love with me, oh yeah

You know I want a little girl, she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book
But if she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T, now

Oh, she don't have to wave her hair
Or wear fancy clothes and I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear nylon hose, oh

'Cause I want a little girl to love a lot
I say I'd give her everyting I got, now
Because I want a little firl, now, to fall in love with me, yeah
