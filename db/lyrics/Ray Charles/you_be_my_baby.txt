You be my baby
Don't give me no maybe
Never, never make you cry

You be my honey
Give you all my money
I will 'til the day I die

Because I (never, never, never felt such a thrill)
And I (never, never, never felt this way until)
Woah (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, can't get my fill)

You upset my world
Come closer, girl

You be my lover
There's no one above ya
I want everyone to know

You look so tasty
Like whipped cream pastry
Never, never let you go

Because I (always, always, always want you by my side)
(Always, always, always keep you satisfieed)
You know (wanna, wanna, wanna make you be my bride)
Won't you name the day
Make it right away


You know you please me
Don't ever leave me
I always want you near

You know I need ya
Come let me lead ya
And make all your troubles disappear

Because I (love you, love you, love you everyday)
Yeah (pet you, pet you, pet you in my own way)
You won't (ever, ever, ever need to go astray)
You understand
Am I your man?

Yeah, baby, you know it's alright
Come on, baby, and love me tonight
Woah, baby, I wanna talk to you
I need you, baby, to see me through
