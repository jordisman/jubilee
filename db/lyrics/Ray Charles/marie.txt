Marie, the dawn is breaking
Marie, you'll soon be waking
To find your heart is aching
And tears will fall as you recall

The moon, in all its splendor
A kiss, so very tender
The words "Will you surrender
To me?" woah my Marie

The moon, in all its splendor
A kiss, so very tender
The words "Will you surrender
To me?" woah my Marie

Oh, my Marie
