What Would I Do (Without You)  
(Candy and flowers)
For my Valentine
(Minutes and hours)
You stay on my mind
(Romance and love songs)
I'm down on my knees
(Promise me you'll belong)
Oh to only me

But that's just a start
What I'm trying to say
I'd give you my heart
But it's yours anyway

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
(I love only you)
And nobody else
(With feelings so new)
Like I've never felt
(Come hold my hand)
Aw, get all closer to me
(Cause you understand)
How true love should be

But that's just a start
What I'm trying to say
I'd give you my heart
But it's yours anyway

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you, yeah
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without.....

Your kisses and your tender touch
I love you I love you I love you so much
Baby there's something I want you to know
I'm gonna die if you ever go

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
Forever's not long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do (yeah)
