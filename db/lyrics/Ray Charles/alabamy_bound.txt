I'm Alabamy bound, there'll be no Jeebie
Jeebies hangin' 'round.
Just give the meanest ticket man on earth
All I'm worth, to put my tootsies in an upper birth.
Just hear the choo choo sound, I know that
Soon we're goin' to cover ground, and then
I'll holler, so the world will know,
Here I come, I'm Alabamy Bound,
