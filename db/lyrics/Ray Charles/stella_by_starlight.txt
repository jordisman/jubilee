The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at even tide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight and not a dream
Mmm, my heart and I agree
She's everything on Earth to me

(The murmur of a brook at even tide)
(That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide)

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight and not a dream
Oh, my heart and I agree
She's everything on Earth to me (on  Earth to me)
