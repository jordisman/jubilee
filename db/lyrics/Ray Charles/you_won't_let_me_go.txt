I want you, I need you, I'm all packed up to go
But darlin, if you love me, you wont let me go

If a love's a true love, it never runs smooth you know
So if your love is a true love, you wont let me go

If you dont say you love me, I'm gonna walk right
Out the door
And I'll hope that you'll stop me, so I can hear you
Call me darlin once more

I tell you I love you, yes I love you
With all my heart and soul, so darlin if you love me
You wont let me go

[Solo Piano]

Hey I love you now, I say I love you
Oh with all my heart and soul
So darlin well if you love me
I know you wont let me go
Girl I know you wont let me go
