Every time it rains, you know I think of you
And that's the time, well, I feel so blue
When the rain starts to fall
Across my windows pane
And now it's raining teardrops from my eyes

Well if you see clouds here in my eyes
You know it's just because you said goodbye
Although the sun is shining
There's no sunny skies
Because it's raining teardrops from my eyes

Remeber the night you told me
Our love would always be
But I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you came back to me

Every single cloud would dissappear
I'd wear a smile, baby if you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Because I need you so
I tell you it's just raining teardrops from my eyes

Remeber that night you told me
Our love would always be
But I wouldn't be blue and lonely
Well, if you came back to me

Every single cloud, I tell you  would dissappear
And I'd wear a smile, baby if you were here
So baby won't you hurry
'Cause I need you so
To stop this raining teardrops from my eyes
I say it's raining, ooh yeah
