No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, oh so neat, has Sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and want to die for Sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why
You know i don't lie, not much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came, why it's a shame how she cools them down
Men she can't get are men she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet georgia brown
