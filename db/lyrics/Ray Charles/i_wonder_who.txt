I...I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I've gone
I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I've gone
I wonder who, baby's, gonna be carryin' my lovin' on

You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find a new love, baby, won't you please tell me so
Well it might break my heart but still I wanna know

And if the flame, I say if the flame
You hear me if the flame, don't you know if the flame
If the flame in your heart only burns true love for me
Well don't you let nobody turn their backs on me

You know when I, I say when I
You know when I, I want you know when I
When I lost my baby, I lost the best friend I ever had
And If I don't find my baby, hey hey hey, it's gonna drive me mad, yeah
