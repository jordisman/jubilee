Well, your old girlfriend told me your new lover left you
But you're too proud to tell ol' you know who
J., you don't have time to work me in your busy schedule
But I know you're only busy bein' sad and blue

So who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who

Well, I heard you were lonely, so I wanted to call you
I thought you'd say that I'm the one you missed
But when you picked up the phone, you pretended not to know me
When I told you I still love you, you replied, Who's this? that's right

Well, who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who

Well, you haven't called me up in a whole month of Sundays
So I went out and I found somebody new
You're lying on me, honey
'Cause I got too much pride to spend my life waitin' on your phone call
Now he was gone and I'm alone, but I'm not missin' you

So who cares (who cares) if you're feelin' lonely?
Who cares (who cares) if you're sad and blue?
Who cares (who cares) if you got no one to love you?
Well, who cares? I do, that's who
Yeah, who cares? I do, that's who
