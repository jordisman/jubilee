My mother told me before she passed away,
Said, "Son, when I'm gone, don't forget to pray
'Cause there'll be hard times, Lord those hard times -
Who knows better than I?"

Well I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay the rent;
Talkin' 'about hard times, hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman, Lord, who was always around,
But when I lost my money, she put me down.
Talkin' 'bout hard times, you know those hard times,
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days, there'll be no sorrow
When I pass away,
And no more hard times,
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?
