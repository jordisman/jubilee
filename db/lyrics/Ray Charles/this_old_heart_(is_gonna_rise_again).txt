Look down on me if you want to, ooh baby
You can count me out, don't count long
I've lost my taste for love before
It goes away, but it don't stay gone
I feel it in my bones, my bones

This old heart, this old heart
This old heart, this old heart

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

Well, I cried till I'm all out of teardrops
And I hurt till I'm all out of pain
Then I wait for the first love that comes down the track
Like a hobo waiting for a train, oh

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

You may wonder just what keeps me going
It's the true love that waits down the line
I know that heartbreak is one more behind me
And true love is getting closer all the time

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart, this old heart
This old heart is gonna rise again

This old heart is gonna rise again
This old heart is gonna rise again
