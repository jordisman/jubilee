Heartbreaker, Girl you sure is gone
Heartbreaker, Girl you sure is gone
Heartbreaker, how you carry on.

You a bobby soxer mean mistreated too
You a bobby soxer mean mistreated too
You just a little school girl, 
But you sure know what to do.

Pretty baby, in your new red dress
Pretty baby, in your new red dress
When I'm not around ya, 
I can't hardly get my rest.

Heart-Teaser, 
You runnin all around
Heart-Teaser, Girl, 
You runnin all around
And if you don't stop baby, 
You'll be sleeping in the ground

How can I help it, 
If I'm in love with you.
I've been your fool baby, 
Tell me what more can I do.

Heartbreaker, you think you're smart
Heartbreaker, you think you're smart
Well, Heartbreaker, I want to tell ya' 
You broke my heart

You know, you broke my heart
You said we would never part

You told me, we would never part

You know you broke my heart
