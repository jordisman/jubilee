When I need company
I call on you to see about me
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

When you're with me, there's so much fun
You're all the good things all wrapped in one
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

Whoa, I wanna walk, walk about
I wanna talk, talk about
I wanna tell, wanna tell the world all about you

Ohh, I wanna live just for you
I'm gonna give love so true
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new

Ohh, You're so fine and you're so sweet
You're better at love than K.B.B1
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

Ohh, I gonna live just for you
I'm gonna give love so true
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new

Ohh, You're so fine and you're so sweet
You're better at love than K.B.B2
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about, tell the world about you
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you
