I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

Every road must have a turning
I know that's one thing that you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be

I found a love just a little bit truer
I found a heart just a little bit newer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

Girl, I found a love just a little bit truer now
I found a heart just a little bit newer
Well I cried for you
Woah, and it's your turn to cry over me
