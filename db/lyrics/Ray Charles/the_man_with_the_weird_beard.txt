Straggly raggly hair on his chin
Battered and tattered and ugly as sin
Eagle-eyed and floppy-eared
He's the man with the weird beard

Who is he, what is he, nobody knows
Both of his heels are as bare as his toes
Never had his whiskers sheared
He's the man with the weird beard

It ain't black
It ain't white
It ain't short, it ain't long
It just ain't right
It's the craziest garden of hair
Seven robins live in there

Walk with him, talk with him
What do you find?
More on his chin
Than he's got on his mind
And that's the story that I heared
'Bout the man with the weird beard

(Straggly raggly hair on his chin)
(Battered and tettered and ugly as sin)
(Eagle-eyed and floppy-eared)
(He's the man with the weird beard)

(Who is he what is he, nobody knows)
(Both of his heels are as bare as his toes)
(Never had his whiskers sheared)
(He's the man with the weird beard)

It ain't green (no)
It ain't gray (no)
It ain't oats, it ain't corn
It ain't hay (nay nay)
It's a jungle that hangs from his ears
He ain't seen his feet for years

Look at him, look at him
Dressed in his best
Wearin' a beaver
Instead of a vest
You ain't lived until you've heared
'Bout the man with the weird beard

I said the man with the weird beard
I mean the man with the weird beard
I said the man with the weird beard
