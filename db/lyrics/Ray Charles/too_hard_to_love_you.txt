Well, I'm going down to the station
Leaving on the midnight train
I ain't coming back here ever again
Baby, did you hear what I'm sayin'

You're making it too hard to love you
You're making it too hard
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, woman
I can't make enough money for you
I can't make enough money for you

Well, I'm working all day like a prisoner
Sweating for the overtime, babe
By the time I get home you're messin' around
Spending all that money away

You're making it too hard to love you, girl
You're making it too hard
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, baby
I can't make enough money for you
I can't make enough money for you

Well, I heard that whistle blow
I have nothing else on my mind
I've got one foot standing up next to the track
The other one waiting behind

You're making it too hard to love you, girl
You're making it too hard, babe
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, but girl, no
I can't make enough money for you...
