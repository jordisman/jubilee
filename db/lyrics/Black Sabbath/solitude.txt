My name—it means nothing.
My fortune is less.
My future is shrouded
In dark wilderness.

Sunshine is far away.
Clouds linger on.
Everything I possessed—
Now they are gone.
They are gone.
They are gone.

Oh, where can I go to
And what can I do?
Nothing can please me.
Only thoughts are of you.

You just laughed
When I begged you to stay.
I've not stopped crying
Since you went away.
You went away.
You went away.

The world is a lonely place.
You're on your own.
Guess I will go home,
Sit down and moan.

Crying and thinking
Is all that I do.
Memories I have
Remind me of you.
Of you.
Of you.
