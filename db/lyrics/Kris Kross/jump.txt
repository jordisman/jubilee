Jump, jump
You should know, you should know that ahhh
Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally crossed out
We commence to make you

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya Jump Jump
The Daddy Mac will make ya Jump Jump
Kris Kross will make ya Jump Jump

Don't try to compare us to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad givin' ya something that you never had
I'll make ya bump hump wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna Jump
How high? Real high
Cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside-out its wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
R&B - rap is bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
And ain't nuthin' soft about Kris Kross we all that
So when they ask do they rock say believe that

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump
Kris Kross will make ya jump, jump
Uh huh uh huh
Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump
Kris Kross will make ya jump, jump

I like my stuff knockin' knockin'
I love it when a girlies be like jockin' jockin'
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah you know me
I got you jumpin' an' bumpin' an' pumpin' movin' all around
G In the mix I made MC's steps back
They tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear that's coincidental
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental

Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuttin' fake and you can understand every word
As you listen to my cool smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P

Jump Jump
The Mac Dad will make you jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make you jump, jump
Kris Kross will make you jump, jump
Uh huh uh huh
Jump Jump
The Mac Dad will make you jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make you jump, jump
Kris Kross will make you jump, jump

Now, the formalities of this and that
Is that Kris Kross ain't comin' off wack
And for all ya'll sucks that don't know
