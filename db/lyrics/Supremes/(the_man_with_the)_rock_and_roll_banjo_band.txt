He's a groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

I got a sweet little guy
Who lives down the street
But nobody knows his name
Everybody was sad and feeling so bad
But that was before he came

Now everybody in the neighborhood
Seems to walk with a steady beat
By the rhythm of the guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

The way he plays that thing
It makes my poor heart ring
I'm gonna marry that guy someday

If you wanna know why I love him so
Then you ought to come and hear him play
From the dawn to the sunset
He keeps a-strumming on his banjo strings

He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The way he plays that thing
It makes my poor heart ring
I'm gonna marry that guy someday

If you wanna know why I love him so
Then you ought to come and hear him play
From the dawn to the sunset
He keeps a-strumming on his banjo strings

He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band
He's the groovy swinging guy
