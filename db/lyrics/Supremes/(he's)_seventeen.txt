Seventeen
I've got a guy that is seventeen
I don't care because I'm just sixteen
And my guy is seventeen
He's only seventeen

He loves me
And we're as happy as two can be
We have pledged our love eternally
And my guy is seventeen

I don't know what it is
That makes me love him so
I don't know if I shall ever let him go, go, go
Don't you know, know, know

He's seventeen
I've got a guy that is seventeen
I don't care because I'm just sixteen
And my guy is seventeen
He's only seventeen

Guess what girls
My guy is seventeen
Seventeen?
Yeah, guess what else girls
I'm just sixteen
Sixteen?
So come on

Don't you know, you know he's seventeen
I've got a guy that is seventeen
I don't care because I'm just sixteen
And my guy is seventeen
He's only seventeen
