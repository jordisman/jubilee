It was an April morning when they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?

With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had
Whoa, the songs to sing when we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil is in his hole

Oh to sail away to sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream, hides inside and never seen

Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitments fell in pieces on the ground

Oh to ride the wind, to tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud, dancing as we fought the crowd

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone

If one bell should ring in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat as proud the head with heavy feet

Days went by when you and I bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant our mutual child did grow

Oh the sweet refrain soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again

Wondering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth

The mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
