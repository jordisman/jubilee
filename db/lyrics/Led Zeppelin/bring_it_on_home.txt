Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
Take my seat, right way back
I watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out, man move

Try to tell you, baby
What you tryin' to do?
Tryin' to love me, baby
Love some other men too

Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Went a little walk downtown,
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting,
It said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it back home
Bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby,
You love to mess me 'round
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby,
Gonna move you out of town

Bring it on home

Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby,
I'm gonna give you more

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Alright

Bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
