Man, let me hear that, man
You gon' pay at that?

Man, the scene was so thick: low-riders, seventy-seven Sevilles, El Dawgs, nothing but them 'llacs. All the players, all the hustlers. I'm talking about a black man heaven here. You know what I'm saying? Peace.

It's beginning to look a lot like what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season
Here's my ghetto rep I kept to say
The least no no it can't cease

So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather have to
Find something to do better bet!
I said subtract so shut up that
Nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk
If it ain't real ain't right

I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth
I chill with Wesson
Got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck
To help y'all deck the halls

Oh no, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo
I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year
Can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books
I thought you knew
So now you know
Let's go

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangster ride
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happening all day every day

Hallelujah hallelujah
You know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player doing what the players do
The package store was closed
Okay my day is ruined

This is ridiculous
I'm getting serious
I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling sick
The chitlins old as bitches

I make no wishes
'Cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy
Off the nog and high as hell off
The contact smoke

They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses
'Cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts
I'm making switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side
Looking for whores and snitches

I'm wide open on the freeway
My pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three sixty five
It's just another day of work to me
The spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce
See what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah

Forever pimping,
Never slipping,
That's how it is
Check it!

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangster ride
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happening all day every day

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto
So I won't be hanging my socks on no tip
I'm fit as a tick
Fix me a drink
I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham
Not don't need no ham
Hocks
Don't play me like I'm smoking rocks

I got the munchies
We got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know
'Cause in ninety three that's how we coming
So hoe hoe hoes
Check my king ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so on

It goes hit me ten
And I'll serve you then now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac my heart does not go pitty pat
For no rat
I'm leaning back my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo
Fills my body
Where's the party

We roll deep we dip to underground
See's a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, four, a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun,
P Funk spark another one

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangster ride
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happening all day every day

Here's a little something for all the players out there hustling, getting down for theirs. From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar. You know niggas worldwide, down for theirs.

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangster ride
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happening all day every day
