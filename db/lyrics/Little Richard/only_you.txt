Only you
Can do make all this world seem right,
Only you
Can do make the darkness bright,
Only you, and you alone
Can feel me like you do
And do fill my heart with love for only you.

Only you
Can do make all this change in me,
For it's true
You are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do,
You're my dream come true,
My one and only you.

Only you
Can do make all this change in me,
For it's true
You are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do,
You're my dream come true,
My one and only you.
