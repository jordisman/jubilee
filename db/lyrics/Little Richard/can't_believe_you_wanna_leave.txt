I can't believe you wanna leave 
When you know it'd hurt me so 
And on bending knees 
I beg you please not to go 

Take the vows of love we had 
And all the fun that we had 
And now you know you wanna leave 
Don't you know that it'd drive me mad 

My life 
My heart 
My love in your hands 
And now you want to leave me 
You wanna leave me for another man 

Take the vows of love we had 
And all the fun that we had 
And now - you wanna leave 
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad 

My hear 
My love 
My life is in your hands 
And now - you want to leave me 
You wanna leave me for another man 

Take the vows of love we had 
And all the fun that we had 
And now you know you wanna leave 
Now, don't you know that would drive me mad
