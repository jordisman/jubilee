Run here, pretty mama
Sit down on your daddy's knee
I'm gonna tell everybody, baby
How you've been sending me
You're sending me

She got great, big legs
And she [?]
My way from the ground

And every time you kiss me, baby
Don't you know my love, my love
Come tumbling down, come running on down

Mama, if that's your secret
Baby, you better keep it, you better keep it
You better keep it all to yourself

Because if you tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me mama
I'm gonna surely, surely tell somebody else
Gonna tell somebody else
[?]

I said take me, pretty mama
Oh, I want you to rock me
[?] rock me, baby
Throw me in that big brass bed

I want you to rock me, rock me
Rock me, rock me, rock me, mama
Until my face turn cherry, cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red, cherry red
I said cherry red

I want you to hug me, mama
Kiss me and hug me and
Throw me in your big brass bed
