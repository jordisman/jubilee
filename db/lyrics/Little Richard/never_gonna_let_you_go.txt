Hey, honey, you
You are the sweetest
But I
I never tell
'Cause baby, I
I wanna keep you
All, all to myself

'Cause when we're all alone
My heart turn upside-down, yeah
Honey, I know, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go
Child, ow, ow, ow, ow

I, I want you to meet me
I said meet me a little less than halfway
And all, all you gotta do, you gotta do is treat me
I said treat me like you used to do every day

'Cause when we're all alone
Lord, my heart turn upside-down, yeah
Honey, I know, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go
Child, I'm never gonna let you go, oh oh oh ooh ooh ooh
I'm never gonna let you go
