Some want the crown 
But they won't bear their cross
It takes everything to serve the Lord

Some want bright mansions
But they won't pay the cost
It takes everything to serve the Lord

It takes your hands and your head and your heart
Yes, it takes you all!
It takes everything to serve the Lord

It takes your time and your means and your prayers
Lest you fall
It takes everything to serve the Lord

Some wear His name while they still live in shame
It takes everything to serve the Lord

You know who they wanna seen
But they don't want to clean
It takes everything to serve the Lord

It takes your hands and your head and your heart
Yes, it takes you all!
It takes full surrender to serve my Lord

It takes your time and your means and your prayers
Lest you fall
It takes everything to serve my Lord
