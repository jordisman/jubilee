Yes, me friend, me friend
Dem set me free again
Yes, me friend, me friend
Me deh 'pon street again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
They try to keep me down
But God put I around

Yes, I've been accused
Wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the most high
They've got to turn me loose

Don't try to cut me off on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion, the highest region
So if you a bull-bucka, let me tell you that
I'm a duppy conqueror - conqueror

Yes, me friend, me good friend
Dem set me free again, mm
Yes, me friend
Dem turn me loose again

Don't try to cut me off on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion, the highest region
So if you a bull-bucka, let me tell you that
I'm a duppy conqueror - conqueror

(Yes, me friend) Me friend, me friend, me friend
We deh a street again
Yes, me friend, me friend, me friend
Dem set me free again
