Little star lite, little star so bright
You're the first little star, I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish, I wish tonight

Sometimes I'm happy and sometimes I'm blue
My only wish is depending on you
Although you are so very far
Please, help me, help me, little star

There is something about her that I cannot explain
And to be without her, it would drive me insane
Little star above, my wish is of
My only, my only, only love

Little star, little star

If she only knew, the pain in my heart
And what I went through, since we've been apart
Little star aglow, if she should know
Then you should tell her, tell her
Tell her so
