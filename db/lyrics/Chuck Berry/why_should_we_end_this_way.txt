If I should lose you it would hurt so bad
You are the only love that I've had
Tell me why
Why should it end this way

You know it hurts me deep in my heart
To know that we are drifting apart
Tell me why
Why should it end this way

Yes, I could scream, I want you to know
It'll hurt me so bad if you should go
Tell me why
Why should it end this way
