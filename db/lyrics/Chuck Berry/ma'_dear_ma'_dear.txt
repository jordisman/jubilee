Ma' dear, ma' dear, she told me one day
That I'd meet my true love and take her away
She said I'd be happy and to be good and true
I'd never be lonely, broken hearted or blue

Ma' dear, ma' dear, just like you said
I met my true love one and we are to wed
Ma' dear, she's an angel and I'm goin' to be true
Or else I may lose her, I don't want to lose her to somebody new

Ma' dear, ma' dear, I was not untrue
I tried hard to please her, but she's gone and I'm blue
Ma' dear, I'm so lonesome, broken hearted, too
Ma' dear, ma' dear, oh, ma' dear, what must I do?
