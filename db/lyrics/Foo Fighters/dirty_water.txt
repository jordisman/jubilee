I've been drinking dirty water
But I've been here before, after all
The witching hour is upon us
So you and I can sing haunted songs

In my dreams I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on
On and on

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms

You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row
I've been drinking dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold
All we know

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
I'm a natural disaster
And you're the morning after all my storms

Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
Dirty water in my blood

I feel a moment coming on
Heavy metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms
