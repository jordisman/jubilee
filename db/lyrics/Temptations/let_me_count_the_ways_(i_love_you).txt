There's so many ways
That I want to say
I love you
Yes (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Let me count the ways
That I wanna say
I love you

(Number one) To me you're very pretty
(Number two) When you talk, you sound so sexy
(Number three) You wear such lovely perfume!
(Number four) You're as sweet as candy
(Number five) And you give so much strength to me
(Number six) How complete, baby, you understand me

All the fellas in the world
Wish they had a special girl
Just like you, mama
But that could never ever be
'Cause you know you belong to me
I love you, yes

If you
Should ever leave me, little girl
I know
I would just die!

Oh! (I love you)
Yes I do (I love you)
You know it's true (I love you)
Hey hey! (Oh! I love you)
Yes I do (I love you)
You know it's true (I love you)
Hey hey! (I love...!)

You
You
You (oh you)
You
I love you!

You
You
You (oh you)
You
I love you!

I love you baby

(Number one) To me you're very pretty
(Number two) When you talk, you sound so sexy
(Number three) You wear such lovely perfume!
(Number four) You're as sweet as candy
(Number five) And you give so much strength to me
(Number six) How complete, baby, you understand me

You
You
You (oh you)
You
I love you!
