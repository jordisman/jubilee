I
[Dennis:] Can turn a gray sky blue.
[Melvin:] I can make it rain, whenever I wanted to.
Oh, I
[Eddie:] I can build a castle from a single grain of sand.
[Paul:] I can make a ship sail, uh, on dry land.

[Dennis:] But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue. 'Cause I can't get next to you.

I can't get next to you, babe. (Next to you)
I can't get next to you. (I just can't get next you)
I can't get next to you, babe.
I can't get next to you.

I
[Dennis:] Can fly like a bird in the sky.
[Eddie:] Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy.
Oh, I
[Paul:] I can turn a river into a raging fire.
[Melvin:] I can live forever if I so desired.

[Eddie:] Unimportant are all the things I can do. 'Cause I can't get next to you.

I can't get next to you, babe. (No matter what I do)
I can't get next to you.
Uh-ya

[Instrumental]

Ooo-Ooo
Ooo-Ooo
Chica boom, chica boom
Chica boom, boom, boom

[Dennis:] I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can.
I
[Otis:] I can make the seasons change, just by waving my hand.
Oh, I
[Eddie:] I can change anything from old to new.
[Paul:] The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do.

[Dennis:] Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess. 'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness.
[Eddie:] And I

Can't get next to you.

Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get... (Next to you)
