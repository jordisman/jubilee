Treat her like a lady

Now I'm the kinda guy who don't believe that chivalry is dead, no
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated with the utmost respect
Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away, I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame, just come and look me over

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, more, more, more

Now I like openin' doors pickin' up her hanky off the floor
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes, even (help her with her coat), well
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
In this world of liberation it's so easy to forget
That it's so nice to have a man around to lend a helping hand you can bet, bet you can, baby

When I was young, my mama used to say, boy
A woman's like a flower, with love on her you shower
Ever since that day, her words never went away
I always will remember to treat my baby tender

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, more, more, more

Now I like openin' doors pickin' up her hanky off the floor
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes, even (help her with her coat)
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Compliment her on her hair, even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
She's a bad son-of-a-gun, I'm her lovin' Don Juan
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)

Every day, ever way
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

(You'll find a heart)
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, more, more, more

Now I like openin' doors pickin' up her hanky off the floor
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Light her cigarette if she smokes, even (help her with her coat), help her out
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Compliment her on her hair, even help her with her chair
Treat her like a lady (treat her like lady)
Now boy, you should remember to be a gentleman
Treat her like a lady

You better
Treat her like (well), treat her like (ho)
Treat her like a lady (treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (hey)
Treat her like a lady (treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (well)
Treat her like a lady (treat her like a lady)
Treat her like, treat her like (ooh)
Treat her like a lady
(Oh, my, my, treat her like a lady)
