Disconnect the phone
I can't wait to get you alone
Put the music on
And make the groove real slow
Tonight I'm here to stay
So put on your naughty negligee
Open up the wine
And just let it flow

The world can go and fall apart
And I won't even hear it start
Oh, no

Cause I've got love on my mind tonight
There ain't no way to conceal it
I've got love on my mind tonight, baby
One look at you and I feel it
I've got love on my mind tonight
On my mind tonight

These are crazy days
It's like you're running through an endless maze
Coming home to you
Just in the nick of time
Come and fill your cup
All day long

I've been building up
Let me melt your body
Wooo-oooh, into mine

Forget about the world outside
Inside each other we can hide
Cause I've got love on my mind tonight
There ain't a way to conceal it
I've got love on my mind tonight, hey hey
One look at you and I feel it
I've got love on my mind tonight
On my mind tonight

I've got loooove on my mind tonight
There ain't no way to conceal it
I've got looove on my mind tonight
One look at you and I feel it
I've got love on my mind tonight
On my mind tonight
Ahhhhhhh
Do, do, doo, dooo

Baby, give it to me, girl
You know I want it, girl
Girl, girl
You know what to do
You know what I want and you know what I need
Oh, baby
