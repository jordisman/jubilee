Well, I rocked over Italy and I rocked over Spain.
I rocked in Memphis;
it was all the same
till I rocked to Africa.
I rolled off the ship.
I seem them natives doin' an odd looking skip.
I parted the weeds
and I looked over the swamp,
and I seen them cats doin' the Ubangi Stomp.
Ubangi Stomp is a rock and roll.
It beats anything that's ever been told.
Ubangi Stomp, Ubangi style;
when it kicks,
it drives a cool cat wild.
Well I looked up the chief;
he invited me in.
He said, "A heap big jam session's 'bout to begin."
I grabbed up a tom and I picked up the beat.
That crazy thing sent
shivers to my feet.
I rocked and I rolled
and I skipped with a smile.
I did the Ubangi Stomp with a Ubangi style.
Well, we rocked all night and part of the day.
Had a good, rock-in' time
with the chief's daughter Mae.
I'm makin' good time and I'm gettin' in the know when the captain said, "Son, we've gotta go." I said, "That's all right.
You go right ahead.
I'm gonna Ubangi Stomp till I roll over dead."
Ubangi Stomp is a rock and roll.
It beats anything that's ever been told.
Ubangi Stomp, Ubangi style;
when it kicks,
it drives a cool cat wild.
Ubangi Stomp, thank you.
