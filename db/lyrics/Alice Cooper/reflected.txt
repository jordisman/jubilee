Look upstanding with your head held high you will be reflected
You look outstanding with your eyes in disguise just beyond your glasses
Holy how he would keep it's devine I'm surely glad I'm surely over town
And even though I'm you will always here
Very rarely worry almost constantly could you be receptive
Our life's outstanding in a shower please wet my skins a plenty
Baby what a day I love our town I'm surely glad I'm surely all around
And even since I knew it all so clear
You will be reflected you will be reflected you will be reflected
You will be reflected you will be reflected reflected
