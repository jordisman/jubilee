What did I do to deserve such a fate I didn't really want to get involved in this thing
Someone handed me this gun and I I gave it everything yeah I gave it everything
I came into this life looked all around I saw just what I liked and took what I found
Nothing came easy nothing came free nothing came at all until they came after me yeah hey yeah 
What did I do to deserve such a fate I gave it everything now I need to escape
Someone near to me calling my name I gave it everything I gave it everything
