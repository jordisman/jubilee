Your childish game is over now.
Lost your power over night some how.
Better see it ain't gonna be like it used to be.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.
Lots of time late at night, I really needed you.
I'm telling you tonight's the night.
Close your mouth;
turn off the light.
Pull me babe.
Pull me down closer on you.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.
Lots of time late at night, I really needed you.
I really needed you.
I really needed you.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.
Quit your tears and dry your eyes.
You know I hate to see you cry.
Don't you see,
things gotta be what they got to.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at
me.
And oh, that music,
I hate those lyrics.
It stayed inside me so long.
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.
But pardon me,
I'm not lookin' for sympathy,
Not sympathy.
I'm just thinking out loud.
the melody,
it goes nowhere pointlessly.
Silence please.
I been livin' in my own shell so long...
the only place I ever feel at home.
And oh, that music,
I hate those lyrics.
It stayed inside me so long.
And I swear to you I never.
