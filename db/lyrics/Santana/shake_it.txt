Doesn't matter what I know
Gonna find the groove, baby, don't let go
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Gonna make you shake, gonna make you move

Come on over, light the fire
Red and hot 'til you can't get higher
Make it sought, doin' it rough
I won't stop 'til you've had enough

Gimme some love when I lay it down
Givin' it up, never touch the ground
Playin' it hot, makin' it loud
You want more, more, more, more, yeah
Gracias a nuestra madre
Y padre por el tambo

Shake

Gimme the sticks and gimme the skin
You're gonna know what shape I'm in

Gimme some love when I'm layin' it down
Givin' it up, never touch the ground
Playin't it hot, makin' it loud
You want more, more, more, more, yeah
