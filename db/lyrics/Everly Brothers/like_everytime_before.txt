If you would only look into my eyes
Then you would see the truth within them lies
That I am trying hard to bring us back together
You try so hard to complicate our love
But underneath it all it's pride my love
That's hurting us and keeping us apart
If you'd only realise

I've been happy with you once before
Can't you let it be the same and more
Without you fighting me fighting me
I start to wonder if it's worth it all
But then I look at you and start to fall
In love again like every time before
If you'd only realise

I've been happy with you once before
Can't you let it be the same and more
Without you fighting me fighting me
I start to wonder if it's worth it all
But then I look at you and start to fall
In love again like every time before
In love again like every time before
In love again like every time before
