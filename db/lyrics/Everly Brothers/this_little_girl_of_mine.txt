This little girl of mine,
I want you people to know
This little girl of mine,
I take her everywhere I go

One day I looked at my suit, my suit was new
I looked at my shoes and they were too
And that's why, why, why, why I oh yeah,
Love that little girl of mine

This little girl of mine,
Makes me happy when I'm sad
This little girl of mine,
Love's me even when I'm bad

She knows how to love me right down to her teeth
If she does any wrong, you know she keeps it from me
And that's why, why, why, why I, oh yeah,
Love that little girl of mine

And that's why, why, why, why I, oh yeah,
Love that little girl of mine

This little girl of mine,
Called me last night about eight
This little girl of mine,
Told me that we had a date

She said that she'd meet me at a-quarter to nine,
Believe or not but she was right on time
And that's why, why, why, why I, oh yeah,
Love that little girl of mine

This little girl of mine,
Knows how to dress so neat
This little girl of mine,
Stops the traffic on the street

And when a fella starts a-whistlin', I don't mind
I can't blame him, 'cause she is fine
And that's why, why, why, why I, oh yeah,
Love that little girl of mine
