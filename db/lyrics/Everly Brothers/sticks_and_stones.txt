People talkin' tryin' to break us up
Why won't they let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me

People talkin' tryin' to break us up
When they know I love you so
I don't care what the people may say
I'll never never let you go

I've been abused (I've been abused)
In my heart (My heart and soul)
I've been abused (I've been abused)
I've been abused, (I've been abused and I've been stoned)

People talkin' tryin' to break us up
Scandalize my name
Say anything just to make me feel bad
Anything to make me ashamed

I've been abused (I've been abused)
In my heart (My heart and soul)
I've been abused (I've been abused)
I've been abused (I've been abused and I've been stoned)

People talkin' tryin' to break us up
Scandalize my name
Say anything just to make me feel bad
Anything to make me ashamed
I've been abused (I've been abused)
In my heart (My heart and soul

I've been abused (I've been abused)
I've been abused (I've been abused and I've been stoned)
People talkin' tryin' to break us up
Scandalize my name
Say anything just to make me feel bad
Anything to make me ashamed

I've been abused (I've been abused)
I've been abused (I've been abused)
(I've been abused)
I've been abused (I've been abused)
(I've been abused)
I've been abused (I've been abused)
