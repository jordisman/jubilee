Saturday night, I just got paid
A fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says a-go-go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night,
An' baby I'm a-feelin' fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
Have a ball tonight

Got me a date, I won't be late
I pick her up in my eighty-eight
Shack on down by the union hall
When the joint starts jumpin'
I'll have a ball

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
Have a ball tonight
