Once her smile would make the sun go dim
And then she left me for him
The night she said goodbye
There were tears in her eyes
Where there'd never been tears before

Woh-woh
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
She said, I was just too young
And she would act her age and be too old for me
Now she's got her man
But she's got no time to grin
Like a little girl I once knew before

Woh-woh
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
I would like to talk to her again
But I'd only wind up loving her again
And then
I know we can never love again
They'll always be another guy just like him
But each time she walks by
Inside my heart cries
Why didn't you leave it like before

Woh-woh
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
She never smiles anymore
