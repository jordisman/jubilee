Well if you see ol' Annie, better give her a lift
'Cause Annie's been a-workin' on the midnight shift
If Annie puts her hair up on her head
Paints them lips up bright bright red
Wears that dress that fits real tight
Starts stayin' out late till the middle of the night
Says to her friend, give her a lift
Well Annie's been a-workin' on the midnight shift
If she acts a little funny, seems a little strange
Starts spending your money for brand new things
Tells you that she wants to use the car
Never explains what she wants it for
Brother, there just ain't no ifs
'Cause Annie's been a-workin' on the midnight shift

Well early in the morning when the sun comes up
You look at ol' Annie and she looks kinda rough
You tell her, honey get out of that bed
She says, leave me alone I'm just about dead
Brother, there just ain't no ifs
'Cause Annie's been a-workin' on the midnight shift

If you got a good mama that's stayin' at home
You better enjoy, 'cause it won't last long
When you think everything's all right
She starts slippin' round in the middle of the night
Brother, there just ain't no ifs
'Cause Annie's been a-workin' on the midnight shift
