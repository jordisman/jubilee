Well, I found you're a rover and it's made me blue
Like a talent scout you want some love that's new
Don't come back knocking at my heart's closed door
For I won't be home, don't call an' knock no more

Well, when you went away and left me all alone
While you played around I waited at home
Don't come back knocking at my heart's closed door
For I won't be home, don't call an' knock no more

You had all my heart, it was your very own
You weren't satisfied, now I'll go on alone
Don't come back knocking at my heart's closed door
For I won't be home, don't call an' knock no more
(Oh, let's really knock it this time boys!)

Well, pity those with hearts so empty and cold
To never know true love, a treasure to hold
Don't come back knocking at my heart's closed door
For I won't be home, don't call an' knock no more
