Well, I'm dressed up so nice
An' I'm doin' my best
Yes I'm startin' over..
Startin' over in another place

Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
He's got rings on his finger
And then he walks up, up to the throne

He's makin' shapes with his hands
An' don't choo dare sit down
Now don't choo dare jump back
And don't choo dare stick out!

And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
Ooh and then we let if all
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
Ooh what a day that was.

There are 50,000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
They have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat

Down come a bolt of lightning
Now an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm

I'm dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
And I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions

And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
Ooh and then we let if all
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
Oohh what a day that was.

Oh a day that was
Ooh that's the way it goes
There's a million ways- to get things done
Three's a million ways- to make things work out.

Well I'm going right trough
And the light came down
Well they're roundin' 'em up
from all over town

They're movin' forward and back
They're movin' backwards and front
And they're enjoying themselves
Moving in ev'ry direction

So if you feel like you're in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
And if you feel like talking to someone
Who know the difference between right and wrong

And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
Ooh and then we let if all
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
Ooh what a day that was.

We're going boom boom boom That's the way we live
And in a great big room and That's the way we live.
