Hey, do it now

Hey, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a rock-and-roll band
I never had no problems
Burnin' down the one-night stands

And everything around me
Got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly
Yes, I did
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die."

'Til you die?

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish
To not see I was the one behind

So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step by the way
... we can do
I said, I must go back there
I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die."

'Til you die?
Oh, 'til you die

Gonna play some electrified funky music

Hey, wait a minute

Now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock-and-rolling minds
And things were gettin' shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind

Oh, but now it's so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (you know, I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die."

'Til you die?
Oh, 'til you die

They shouted 

"Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
You got to keep on playin' funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Gonna take you high and low."

"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right

Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right."
