Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live, we learn to give
Each other what we need to survive together alive

Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, Ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, Ivory, Ooh

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live, when we learn to give
Each other what we need to survive together alive

Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, Ivory living in perfect harmony [Repeat and fade...]
