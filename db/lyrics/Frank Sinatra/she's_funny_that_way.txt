I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a man, crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
He doesn't holler, he'd live in a tent
I got a man, crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way and no better plan
End it all and let him go to some other gal
But I'm only human, a coward at best
I know for certain he'd follow me west

I got a man, crazy for me
He's funny that way

Though he loves to work and slave
For me every day
He'd be so much better off
If I went away

But why should I leave him, why should I go?
He'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a man, crazy for me
He's funny that way
