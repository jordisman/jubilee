The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom

And when the twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't pull myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out, and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home, and ask myself "Where is she?"
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly, little mem'ries, my little mem'ries
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Yes, somebody said "Just forget about her"
So I gave that treatment a try
And strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by
Oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
