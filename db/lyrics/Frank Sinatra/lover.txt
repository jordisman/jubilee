Lover, when I'm near you and I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing keep on glancing in my eyes
Till loves own enchanting music dies

All of my future is in you, you're every plan I desire
Promise you'll always continue to be mine

Lover, please be tender when your tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

All of my future is in you, you're every plan I desire
Promise you'll always continue to be mine

Lover, please be tender when your tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart
