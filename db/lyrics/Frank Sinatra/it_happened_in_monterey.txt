It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine

It happened in Monterey without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey

Ah, it happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars, guitars, lips red as wine
Broke somebody's heart and I fear that it was mine

It happened in Monterey and without thinking twice
I left her and I threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, how it longs for that sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey
