I need your love so badly, I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I'd found you but other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true but what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming for I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
'Cuz I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
