I'm sorry dear, so sorry dear
I'm sorry I made you cry
Won't you forget, won't you forgive?
Don't let us say goodbye

One little word, one little smile
One little kiss won't you try?
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
I'm sorry I made you cry

One little word, one little smile
One little kiss won't you try?
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
I'm sorry I made you cry
