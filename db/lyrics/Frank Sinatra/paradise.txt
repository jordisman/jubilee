And then she holds my hand
And then I understand
Her eyes afire
With one desire
A heavenly kiss
Could I resist?

And then she dims the light
And then she holds me tight
One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
