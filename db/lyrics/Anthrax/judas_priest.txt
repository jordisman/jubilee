Filthy with the knowledge I’m
Planting seeds, spreading the disease
Rip away, tear up the beans

Ravaged, it’s all so damaged
You’re locked in

Disinter the ancient ways
Deaf to all that dare to pray

Ravaged, never as savage
And that’s the

Price you pay, open the door
Find the monster, start the war

I’m bound to, bow down to

I am become Death, destroyer of worlds
A menial place in this infinite swirl
Your pitiful lives, and none more the wise
The human condition is dropping like flies
Unleashed is the beast, the worst of the least
From sheer depraved evil like some Judas Priest
Having his way, my canvas unfurled
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds

Reign, reign
The ending of yours has begun
The ending of yours has begun

Who will stand with me in victory?

Chose to trust me better still
You gave your eyes your own freewill
Invulnerable, your boil conceit
I’m leaving you stunned in defeat

Ravaged, so bloody ravaged
You take this

Brutal beating at my hands
Uncivilized my victory stands

Ravaged, never as savage
And that’s the

Price you pay, open the door
Find the monster, start the war

Screaming, rapid fire genocide
Screaming, saints in Hell are running wild
Rage, the prelude had begun
Now your epitaph is sung

Pounding, monolithic fists of stone
Pounding, on the sinner to atone
Rage, the prelude had begun
Now your epitaph is sung

I am become Death, destroyer of worlds
A menial place in this infinite swirl
Your pitiful lives, and none more the wise
The human condition is dropping like flies
Unleashed is the beast, the worst of the least
From sheer depraved evil like some Judas Priest
Having his way, my canvas unfurled
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds

Reign, reign
The ending of yours has begun
The ending of yours has begun

If you look for a monster you’ll find one
The ending for all has begun
