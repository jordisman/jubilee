Far, far, far away - way
People heard him say - say
I will find a way - way
There will come a day - day
Something will be done
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time - time
Time to be - be - be aware
Carter's father saw it there
And knew the Rhull revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye - eye
Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The servicemen were heard to sigh
For there revealed in flowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

Oh - oh - did you ever?
No No never ever will they
I'll say!
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed
