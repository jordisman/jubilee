I know why I waited
know why I've been blue
I've been praying for someone, baby
exactly like you
why should we spend money, on a show or two
while no one does those love scenes, baby
exactly like you

you make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
you seem to understand
each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
and the schemes I'm scheming

now I know why mother taught me to be true
she meant me for someone, baby
exactly like you

just like you, baby, oh
just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you

I know why I waited
know why I been blue
I've been waiting for someone, baby
exactly like you
why should we spend money on a show or two
while no one does those love scenes, baby
exactly like you

you make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
you seem to understand
each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
and the schemes I'm scheming
now I know why mother taught me to be true
she meant me for someone
exactly like you

just like you, baby, just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you
just like you, baby, pretty just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you
