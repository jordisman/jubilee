Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too, yes, Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud

Tough she won't throw a crumb at you
You think someday she'll come to you
Better forget her
her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care

Hey there, won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things to clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other
hmm and out the other, in one ear and out the other

won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things to clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other
hmm and out the other, in one ear and out the other
