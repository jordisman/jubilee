Far away places with strange sounding names
Far away over the sea
Those far away places with strange sounding names
Are calling, calling me

Goin' to China, or maybe Siam
I wanna see for myself
Those far away places
I've been reading about
In a book that I took from a shelf

I start getting restless whenever I hear
The whistle of a train
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain

They call me a dreamer well maybe I am
But I know that I'm burning to see
Those for away places with strange sounding names
Calling, calling me

Calling, calling me
