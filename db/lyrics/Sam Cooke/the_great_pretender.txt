oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
pretending I'm doing well
my need is such
I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

oh yes, I'm  the Great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game
but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-belief
Too real when I feel what my heart can conceal
oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-belief
Too real when I feel what my heart can conceal
oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
