The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
and the melody seemed to say
O, summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may
There beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended and I found at the break of dawn
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on
but the melody lingers on
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
and the melody seemed to say
O, summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may
There beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended and I found at the break of dawn
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on
