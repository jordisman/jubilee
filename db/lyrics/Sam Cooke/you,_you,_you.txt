You, you. you
I'm in love with you, you, you
I could be so true, true, true
to someone like you, you, you

Do, do, do
what you ought to do, do, do
take me in your arms please do
let me cling to you, you, you

we were meant for each other
sure as heaven is above
To have, to hold and to love
You, you, you

There's no one like you, you, you
you could make my dreams come true
if you say you love me too

Do, do, do
what you ought to do, do, do
take me in your arms please do
let me cling to you, you, you

we were meant for each other
sure as heaven is above
To have, to hold and to love
You, you, you

There's no one like you, you, you
you could make my dreams come true
if you say you love me too

you, you, you
I'm in love with you
