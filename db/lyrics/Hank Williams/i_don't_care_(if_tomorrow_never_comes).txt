I don't care if tomorrow never comes
This world holds nothin' for me
I've been lonely night and day ever since you went away
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

[CHORUS]
If tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever shine
It won't matter with me
For when she went away, my world ended that day
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

My lonely mind wanders back to days that used to be
My broken heart cries out for you
Oh, if I can't have you here, I can't go on my dear
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
