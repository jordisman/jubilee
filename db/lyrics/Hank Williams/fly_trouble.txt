DID YOU EVER SIT STRAIGHT UP IN BED 
WITH SOMETHIN' A CIRCLIN' ROUND YA HEAD 
AN YA SWAT AT IT AS IT WIZZES BY 
AND IT'S JUST ONE PESKY LITTLE FLY

YOU SHAKE YA HEAD AN TWITCH YA NOSE 
AND SETTLE DOWN TO SWEEP YA FLOORS
AND WHEN YA JUST ABOUT TO DOSE...FLY TROUBLE

[CHORUS]
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE FLY 
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ HE'S TAKIN OFF AN HIDE

YOU ROLL THE PAPER UP NICE AND TIGHT 
AND WAIT AROUND FOR HIM TO LIGHT 
BUT THEIRS A FLY THAT'S A LIVEN RIGHT
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

[BAND PLAYS]

NOW THE TOUGHEST HIDE GROWS ON A MULE 
CAUSE HE'S A BULKY STUBORN FOOL
HE LIKES TO LOOK AT YU AND GLARE 
AN NEVER EVEN MOVE A HAIR

BUT WHEN HIS MUSCLES START TO TWITCH 
AN WHEN HIS TAIL BEGINS TO SWISH
THAT MULE AIN'T BOTHERED WITH AN ITCH...FLY TROUBLE

[CHORUS]
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE PEST 
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ THAT MULE CAN'T GET NO REST

HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AN BATS HIS EYE
AN KICKS HIS HEELS UP TO THE SKY
DID YOU EVER SEE A JASS ACK CRY
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

[BAND PLAYS]

NOW YOU PICK A PERFECT NIGHT IN JUNE
WHEN FLOWERS ARE BLOOMIN BENEATH THE MOON 
AND YA LIGHT OF LOVE IS SHININ' BRIGHT 
AN YOU TELL YA SELF TONIGHTS THE NIGHT

YA BRACE YA SELF AN YA COURAGE GROWS
AN ON YA KNEES WHERE YOU WOULD PROPOSE
WHEN SOMETHIN BIGHTS YOU ON THE NOSE...FLY TROUBLE 

[CHORUS]
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ GOES THAT BUSY LITTLE THING 
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ YOU SWAT AN LOOSE THE RING

YOU FAN THE AIR AS HE GOES BY
AN STICK YA FINGER IN YOUR EYE
HIT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT FLY
BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ
