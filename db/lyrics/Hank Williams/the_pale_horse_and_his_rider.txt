Listen poor sinner; you're driftin' away 
From the Dear Saviour; who's pleading today
What will you do; when the Saviour ain't nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

The time now ain't long; when the Saviour will come
Then you'll be judged; by the deeds you have done
On that judgement day; you'll weep and you'll cry
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
Not even the angels; in heaven will know
Then's when you'll wish; you had Jesus nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

Won't you redeem; your poor wicked soul
You can't pay your way; with Silver and Gold
If you're not saved; you'll be lost in the night
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
