Now friend if you'll just listen to me you'll get some good hard earned advice
I don't aim to meddle in your business I'm just tryin' to save you an awful price
Now you see these teeth that I ain't got and these knots on my bald head
I'll guarantee you boys I didn't get them there lyin' at home in the bed
Now take the smart aleck in any town of him folks want no part
He acts like his head was only made to hold his ears apart
Now he might like what I'm bout to say and my words might make him sore
But I'm just tryin' to be helpful cause I've been down that road before
To bully folks and play mean tricks was once my pride and joy
Till one day I was toted home and mama didn't know her little boy
My head was swelled up so doggone big I couldn't get it through my front door
Now I ain't just talkin' to hear myself cause I've been down that road before
A little fellow about my size got tired of being pushed about
So he went to work and when he got through he'd knocked every one of my teeth out
One time too many I'd rubbed him wrong and he evened up the score
Now that's what happens when you get too big for your britches
And I've been down that road before
Now when you get to thinkin' you're really smart
There's always somebody smarter than you
And no matter how much you boast and brag you can still learn a thing or two
Go get you some treatments just like I've had and you won't hanker for more
I really learned the meaning of living and loving I've been down that road before
Now the man that walks this rocky road usually gets just what he deserves
Cause he's just a helpless servant to a master that he serves
Now I've learned to slow my temper down and not to pick no scraps no more
Boys it's a lot easier on the head and eyes I've been down that road before
