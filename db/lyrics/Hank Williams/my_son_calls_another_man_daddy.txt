Tonight my heart is bowed in sorrow
I can't keep the tears from my eyes
My Son Calls Another Man Daddy
The right to his love, I've been denied.

[CHORUS]
My Son Calls Another Man Daddy
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face
God only knows how it hurts me
For another to be in my place.

Each night I laid there in prison
I pictured a future so bright
For he was the one ray of sunshine
That showed thru the darkest of nights.

[CHORUS]

Today his mother shares a new love
She just couldn't stand my disgrace
My Son Calls Another Man Daddy
And longs for the love he can't replace.

[CHORUS]
