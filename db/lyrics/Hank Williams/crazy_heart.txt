You thought she'd care for you and so you acted smart
Go on an break, you Crazy Heart
You lived on promises I knew would fall apart
Go on and break you Crazy Heart.

You never would admit you were mis-tak-en
You didn't even know, the chances you were takin'
I knew you couldn't win, I told you from the start
Go on and break you Crazy Heart.

I knew you'd wake up and find her missin'
I tried my best to warn you, but you wouldn't listen
You told me I was wrong, you thought that you were smart
Go on an break you Crazy Heart.
