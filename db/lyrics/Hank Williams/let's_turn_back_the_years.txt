Darling let's turn back my years and go back to yesterday
Let's pretend that time has stopped and I didn't go away
We had our love to make us happy it wasn't meant to bring us tears
Love like ours should never die so darling let's turn back the years
[ steel - guitar ]
We had our love to make us happy...
