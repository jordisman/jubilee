I have heard your stories about your fast trains
But now I'll tell you about one all the southern folks have seen
She's the beauty of the southlands listen to that whistle scream
It's that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.

She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your head out the window and feel that southern breeze
your on that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.

Ohio and Kentucky Tennessee and Alabam, the delta state of 
Mississippi, she's Louisina Bound, of the trains in the southland 
this one is the queen, all the way from Cincinnati down to New Orleans.

If your ever in the south lands and want to see the scenes
Just get your self a ticket on that Pan American Queen
Louiville Nashville Montgomery the cap'tal of Ala-bam
You pass right through then all when your New Orleans bound.

She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your head out the window and feel that southern breeze
your on that Pan American on her way to New Or-leans.
