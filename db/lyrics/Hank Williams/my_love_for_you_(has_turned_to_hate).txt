I'll ne'er forget that sad, sad  day   
Darling that you went away     
You told me that our love was true     
And then you left me 'lone and blue      
Yes I received your note today       
Saying you'd come back and stay       
Don't come back now It is too late         
My love for you has turned to hate        

Don't come back now on your knees       
Trying to take me back please      
Cause you can't mend my broken heart      
Because it died When we were apart       
Yes I received Your note today      
Saying you'd Come back and Stay      
Don't come back now It is too late       
My Love for You Has turned to hate
