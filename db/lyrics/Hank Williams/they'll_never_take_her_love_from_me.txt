If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one smiling face the gods would see
'Cus she'll walk along beside me up the golden stairs
No, they'll never never take her love from me.

What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh, they'll never ever take her love from me.

[Bridge chords for solos]

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
But they'll never never take her love from me.

I thought I'd make her happy if I stepped aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'll never never take her love from me.
