Oh the rain is slowly fallin',
And my heart is so sore,
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Never on this earth to meet no more.

[Chorus]

Six more miles to the graveyard,
Six more miles, long and sad,
Six more miles and leave my darlin',
Leave the best friend, I ever had.

Oh I hear the train a-comin',
Bringin' my darlin' back home,
Six more miles, to the graveyard,
And I'll be left here all a- lone.

[Repeat chorus]

[This verse not on record, but in both early song books:]
Left her in that lonely church yard,
Left my darlin' alone,
Now I'm sad, my heart is cryin',
As i wander thru life alone.
