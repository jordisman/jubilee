You're Window Shoppin'
Just Window Shoppin'
You're only lookin' around
You're not buyin'
You're just tryin'
To find the best deal in town. 

You give away your kisses
But you never give your heart
To anyone who's fool enough to fall ...
You don't feel love
You don't want real love
You're Window Shoppin' that's all.

[Repeat both verses]
