You've got it, I want it. My little Troubleshooter.
I need it, you feed it. My hunger drives me to ya.
You bring me round with your velvet hands; you're gettin' new life to me.
You put me back to promised land, just where you know I should be.

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down

You're givin' I'm gettin'. I'm gettin' satisfaction.
You're makin' I'm takin'. I want some heavy action.
You're bendin' and I'm mendin', gettin' back together.
You really got what it takes to make a bad man better.

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down.
Right down, right down, right down....

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down.
