In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days, (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's nowhere to go

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good

As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Oh no!
Say it isn't true

I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two

I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go...
