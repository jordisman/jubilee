Lost in a dream
I don't know which way to go.
(A-let me say it.)
If you are all that you seem
Then, baby, I'm movin' way too slow.

I've been a fool before.
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
How about some information, please ?

Straight up!
Now tell me, do you really wanna love me forever
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up!
Now tell me, is it gonna be you and me together
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or are you just having fun?

Time's standing still.
Waiting for some small clue.
(A-let me tell ya now.)
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true.

I've been a fool before.
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
How about some information, please?

Straight up!
Now tell me, do you really want to love me forever
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up!
Now tell me, is it gonna be you and me together
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or are you just having fun?

You are so hard to read.
You play hide-and-seek
With your true intentions.
If you're only playing games,
I'll just have to say
A-bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

A-do-do you love me, do-do you love me, baby?
A-do-do you love me, do-do you love me?
A-hey, baby.
A-do-do you love me, do-do you love me, baby?
Come on now.
A-do-do you love me, do-do you love me?
A-tell me, baby.

I've been a fool before.
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history book?

I don't mean to make demands,
But the word and the deed go hand in hand.
How about some information, please?

Straight up. Now tell me (tell me)...
Straight up. Now tell me (tell me)...
Straight up. Now tell me (tell me)...
Straight up. Now tell me...
Straight up. Now tell me...

Straight up!
Now tell me, do you really want to love me forever
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up!

(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or are you just having fun?

Straight up!
Now tell me, do you really want to love me forever
(Oh, oh, oh.)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up!

Or are you just having fun?

Straight up!
Now tell me, do you really want to love me forever
(Oh, oh, oh.)
