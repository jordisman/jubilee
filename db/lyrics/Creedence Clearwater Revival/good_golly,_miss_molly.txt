Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call.

From the early early mornin' till the early early night
You can see miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue light.

Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call.

Well, now momma, poppa told me: "Son, you better watch your step."
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself.

Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call.

I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring.
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen carat golden thing.

Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call.

Good golly, miss Molly,
Sure like to ball.
Good golly, miss Molly,
