Waitress on skates, in trainin'
They dart to call it dreaming
Images present themselves to me
Seeds are ripe for reaping 
I continue sleepin'
You're everything you ever wanted to be
And nothin' here is changing
No messy rearranging 
Cause every set of ficus stays the same
Sinatra's always singing
And you do all the clinging
And someone else accepts my place
Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close

Turn and face my ceiling 
Deep in all the feeling
Inhibitions turn to dust and fly away
Stop my eyelids flickering 
With your petty bickering
But this time I say what I got to say

I hear my girl Dinah's playing 
And tree branches start swayin'
Run over and sit right by the roof
And I see the leaves are growing 
Little buds are showing
Reach out a hand
And bite into the fruit

Whatever my imagination throws 
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close

Nothin' such a scrutiny 
Voiding purple mutual
You are loving beautifully
And it's fragrant beautifully
Colorful and monochrome
Amy Winehouse alone
Far away from ringing phone at home
I turn to stone, turn to stone
And all the thoughts are static
Yeah, my singing is automatic
And I wish that I could sell it
In my every urge you tell her
Cause I can sense no danger
I am the lone ranger
Through the desert in a yellow caddy
With a black haired blue eyed stranger! 

White dress outside drying
I've been fear for flying
I overtake Montgomery in skills, yeah
Never been more daring
Kitten heels I'm wearing 
Reality a blow that sometimes kills

When I drop it lyrically
Words evolve generically
And I don't ever need to collapse in tears
And I could curse your timing 
Thunderously miming
And I feel young beyond my years

Whatever my imagination throws
So rugged, growing rose
When my eyes do close
When my eyes do close
When they close...
