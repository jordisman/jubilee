To know, know, know him 
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, 
Makes my life worthwhile

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I do, I do 

Oh, I'll be good to him, 
I'll bring joy to him
Oh, everyone says 
There'll come a day 
When I'll walk alongside of him
To know him is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, I do

Why can't he see, 
How blind can he be
Someday he'll see 
That he was meant for me

Oh oh, to know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile,  
Oh, it makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I do.
