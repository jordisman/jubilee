Running down my batt-er-ies
Laying me out to rest
Knowing when that in
Five hours
I'll wake up and de-stress
And I'm digging myself into a hole
And these days I just work
When once I had so much soul

[Chorus:]
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now - my mind - is working overtime
It's been a looong day
Such a long day, ay, ay

Mmm and while all my contemporaries
(All my friends, yeah)
Are sitting in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
My guitar through London town
And the thing that wakes me when
I could sleep instead
Is the thought that tonight
I can fall back into bed

[Chorus:]
And lately, I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a looooooong day
It's been a long day (a long day)

Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much

[Chorus:]
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Need to let my energy just drain away
And now my mind is working overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooong
