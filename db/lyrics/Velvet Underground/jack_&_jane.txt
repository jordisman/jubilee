Jack and Jane, well they were quite insane
But did you think that I really cared
Though they tried to get me to insinuate
I couldn't follow them anywhere
Because they weren't ever really there

Oh high and low the little junkies go
But did you hope to get me involved
Even though they follow you most every where
I couldn't talk to them even if I tried
You know they can't see with their eyes open wide

Everybody that you knew was from a book you read
Since they never lived how could you make them dead

Everybody that you knew was from a book you read
Since they never lived how could you make them dead

So it goes, I'm right behind my nose
I follow it wherever it leads
Takes me places no one ever would believe
But they can't follow me even if they try
It's like a camel through a needles eye

Everybody that you knew was from a book you read
Since they never lived how could you make them dead
