[Puff Daddy:]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G.
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

This right here tell me why
Goes out to every one that has lost someone that they truly loved
Come on, check it out

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hanging on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know
That life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream
(that's right)

In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feeling's hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life after death

[Faith Evans:]
Every step I take,
Every move I make
Every single day,
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day,
When you went away
What a life to take,
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

[Puff:]
I miss you B.I.G.

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you're in heaven smiling down
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe

My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6,
Shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Making hits, stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life after death

[Faith Evans:]
Every step I take,
Every move I make
I miss you
Every single day,
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day,
When you went away
What a life to take,
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why

One black morning when this life is over I know I'll see your face

[112 (Puff):]
Every night I pray,
Every step I take
Every move I make,
Every single day

Every night I pray,
Every step I take
(Every day that passes)
Every move I make,
Every single day
(Is a day that I get closer to seeing you again)

Every night I pray,
Every step I take
(We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop)
Every move I make,
Every single day
(Cause we can't stop, that's right)

Every night I pray,
Every step I take
Every move I make,
Every single day
(We miss you, B.I.G.)
