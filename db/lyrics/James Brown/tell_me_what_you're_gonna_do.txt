Tell me what you gonna do, yeah
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna love, love
And make you understand

Tell me what you gonna do, hey
And when [?]
Don't cry, sigh
Don't ever die

I said, you don't love nobody
And you don't need nobody
You don't want nobody
But you always pickin' on me

Tell me what you gonna do
And when walk you home
You wanna love, love
Then leave me all alone

I said, you don't love nobody
And you don't need nobody
You don't want nobody
But you always pickin' on me

Tell me what you gonna do
And when walk you home
You wanna love, love
Then leave me all alone
