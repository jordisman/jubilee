We'll talk about love, it's a talk about shame
Talk about love I hate that name
Love don't love poor me at all
Love is the cause of my downfall

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Love is fine it's from inside side
Love bit me wrong and how I cried
Love made baby, you put me down
And now the news is all over town

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Well! I'll get someone who's better than me
They can be smart and tall as a tree
All I wanna do is rock at home
Love's the proposition from now on!

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

We'll talk about love, it's a talk about shame
Talk about love I hate that name
Love don't love poor me at all
Love is the cause of my downfall

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Love is fine it's from inside side
Love bit me wrong and how I cried
Love made baby, you put me down
And now the news is all over town

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody
