Now here's a story about 
Reppy old jive 
Ooh my my, my honey and me 
I've been diggin' a those stories 
About the west of Kansas that had been told 
Me & my baby out out there 
Dig up a mass of gold 
The minute we found the bare treasure 
I looked up to see 
A great big old lady foot jiving looking 
Dead on me 
And ain't that Dood it 
You know, ain't that Dood it 
I can have no more eyes 
For diggin' up no more gold on 

I grabbed what I had in one hand 
And my baby 'bout the other 
Against grabbed by coat tail and said 
Don't you go another farther 
I ripped of my coat when I was shaken insane 
But what really got my coat 
Was when I heard my baby scream 
Ain't that Dood it 
Ain't that Dood it 
'Cause I ain't going nowhere 
And leave my baby there no 

I put on my breeches and stopped dead in my trackes 
As much as I hated the idea 
I went crawling on back 
I said look here Mr. Giant 
As I raised slowly on one knee 
I'll do anything you say hand my baby to me 
Ain't that Dood it 
Ain't that Dood it 
He said you prefer to lose 
And I'll set your baby free no 

I said I'll make you a proposition 
It's up to you to choose 
Just leave your money or your honey 
One of the two you'll have to leave 
I said Mr. Giant I want to thank you 
For taking the load off my mind 
But when it comes to choose between my money 
And my honey 
I'd take my money 
What am I saying 
I mean my honey every time 
Ain't that Dood it 
You know ain't that Dood it 
Now the Giant got the money 
And I got my honey 
And everybody's feeling fine no
