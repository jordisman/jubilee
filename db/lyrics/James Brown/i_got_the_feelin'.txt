Uh huh, uh uh
I got the feeling
Baby, baby
I got the feeling

You don't know what you do to me
People are heavy, down in misery

Hey, yeah, all right, ow
Hey, hey, ah, good Lord

I got the feeling, all right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

I got the feeling, baby
Baby, sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
My heart, I'm around the town

I'm level with the ground, baby
I said level with the ground
Well, baby, you treat me
You treat me bad

No, no, I know
No, you don't mean it now
Sometimes, I roam
But I'll be coming back home
Sometimes I seem to be fly
I just don't want you
To say, "Bye, bye"

Hey, baby, uh uh...
Waaah, baby
I got that feeling, baby
I have it, all right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

Come on a
Come on now
Oh, oh, oh, oh ...
