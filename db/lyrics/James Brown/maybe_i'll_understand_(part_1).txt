I'm broken hearted
It's my fault
Treated my baby wrong
Now I just got to talk
But help me somebody
I'm a man
Help me somebody
L believe she just don't understand
I'm tryin' so hard
Tryin' so hard
I'm tryin' to do the best I can
Oh yes I am

When I, I lay down
I got my baby on my mind
Yes I have
When I, when I lay down
I got my baby on my mind
Oh yeah
I think about the good things
And the good times
The way she made me feel so fine

I said I'm sittin' in the dark
Right now
And I know I don't need no light
Oh yes I, oh yes I. yes I
I'm sittin' all in the dark
I want the world to know
I don't need no light
I don't need no light
'Cause I'm wondcrin'
I'm wondering where she's gone
And I'm wondenn' what
What she's doin' tonight

And all I can say, all I can say
Is help me somebody
Help me understand
Help me somebody
I know that I'm not a man
'Cause I need her to hold my hand
And maybe
Maybe I'll understand...
