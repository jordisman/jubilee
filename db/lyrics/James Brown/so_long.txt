So long, hope we'll meet again some day
Hope that maybe then you'll say
"Darling, I was wrong"

So long, gee, I hate to see you go
You're the world to me you know
You've been mine, so long

All alone with my memories of you
I can see that you're lonely too
You're my own, even though we're far apart
I will keep you right here in my heart

So long, so long
Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long

Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long
