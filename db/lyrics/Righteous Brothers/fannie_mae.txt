Want somebody, tell me what's wrong with me
I want somebody, tell me what's wrong with me
I ain't misbehaving that I got so much, oh, misery

I can hear your name a ringing on down the line
(Fannie Mae)
I can hear your name ringing on down the line
(Fannie Mae)
I wanna know if you don't, well, tell me if I'm wasting my time

Fannie Mae, baby, won't you please come home?
(Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae, baby, won't you please come home?
(Fannie Mae)
Since you left me, baby, I never felt so all alone

I know oh, woah, oh, oh, hold me
(I know, hold me)
I know oh, woah, oh, oh, hold me
(I know, hold me)
I ain't misbehaving that I got so much, oh, misery

Fannie Mae, baby, won't you please come home?
Fannie Mae, baby, won't you please come home?
Since you left me, baby, I never felt so all alone

Ohh, Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come on home
Ohh, Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come on home

Come home, come home, come home, come on home
Come home, come home, come home, come on home
