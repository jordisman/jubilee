You look as if you're softer than a rosebud
And you're warmer than the sun that makes it grow
Right now you're walking my way
I'm gonna stop you and say
I don't mean to be so bold
But from the things that I've been told
You must be love
Oh huh you must be love, yeah

You look as if you're only out walking
You don't even notice how I'm watchin' you
Hey but the closer you come
You make me feel more numb
Ah-hah I can't say positively
But from the feeling that you give me
You must be love
I do believe that you must be love, yeah

Oh love couldn't possibly be
Anything that you're not
I know that love couldn't possibly have
Anything you haven't got

(You're walking my way, I'm gonna stop you and say)
Oh haw, you may not be the love that I've heard about
But if I had to choose between the two
No question in my mind
I'd take you every time
Although love's been described to me
And you fit the description to a 'T' so,

You must be love
I do believe that you must be love
I can tell by the way you make me feel
I can tell 'cause the feeling is so real
I do believe that you must be love
