Speak low, when you speak love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift
We're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, when you speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon

I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near
Tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time's a thief

I'll wait, darling, I'll wait
The curtain descends and everything ends too soon, too soon

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, darling, I'll wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon...
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon...
You gotta speak love when you speak to me
Oh love, speak low
