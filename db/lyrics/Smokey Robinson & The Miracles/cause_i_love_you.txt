Everytime I see you, baby, you make me feel so fine
Let me tell you, pretty baby, I wish that you would be mine
'Cause I love you, mmh, 'cause I love you

I'm always thinkin', pretty baby, of a way that I could win your heart
Let me tell you, pretty baby, I've wanted you from the start
'Cause I love you, don't you know that I love you

I've wanted you, darling, for as long as I can remember
I know my love for you is true, not just a dying ember

Please tell me, pretty baby, 'cause I've wondered such a long time
If you love me, pretty baby, I'll make your name the same as mine
'Cause I love you
Don't you know that I love you
Don't you know
Doo, doo, doo, doo
