Beware
Beware
Beware

Seems like love should be easier to bear
But it's such a heavy load (A heavy load)
Worldwide traveler, you ain't been nowhere
Till you've traveled down love's road

I know I may be just a stranger (Just a stranger)
Lover, let me warn you there's the danger
Of the fork in love's road

Beware
The danger is there
Ho, ho, ho (Danger)

One way is for those who go along
That way tempts a girl like me
Oh, but lovers don't try to make it on your own 
(Don't try it, don't try it, don't try it)
You don't want the misery

Oh, oh, why didn't I see the sign
Ooh, ooh, before I left my love behind
At the fork in love's road

Beware
The danger is there
Ho, ho, ho

If there is some thing that you don't see eye to eye (Eye to eye)
You better think before you tell your love goodbye (Goodbye)
'Cause your path may never cross again
You make sure you take the same bend
At the fork in love's road, baby

Beware
The danger is there
Watch the fork in the road
You better beware
(The fork in the road)

Beware (Beware)
The danger's there (Beware)
Woo, hoo, hoo (Beware)
(The fork in the road)

The fork in love's road (Beware)
You better beware (Beware)
