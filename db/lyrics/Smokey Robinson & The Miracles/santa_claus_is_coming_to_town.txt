You know, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

And you know that he is makin' up a list
And checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Yeah yeah yeah

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
One more time now

Santa Claus is coming to town
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
Old Saint Nicholas is coming to town
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
I'm tellin' all you kids now you better be good and watch what you do because er-uh
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
You know that Old Saint Nicholas is coming to town
(Santa's coming, Santa's coming)
