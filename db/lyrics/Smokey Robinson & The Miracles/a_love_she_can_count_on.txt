Everyday, I'm gonna love become what may
'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more
To a woman than a love that she can count on
Yeah oh oh oh oh ooh

Darling dear yeah (ooh ooh)
Whenever when you need me I'll be here (ooh ooh)
'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more
To a woman than a love that she can count on

Repeat after me now

The guy next door has money you see (the guy next door has money you see)

And although she may want the things he's buying (tho she accepts the things he's buying)

So baby I want you to see yeah (baby I want you to see)
Oh that you can always count on me
Yeah count on me to comfort you yeah (comfort you)
