Don't you know I'll never let you down
No matter what you do
Don't you know I'll always be around
Just to take care of you

And baby, baby
May our love always remain
Baby, baby
May our love never change
Let no one take my place
Ever baby

I'll be there to take away the pain
Whenever you're hurt inside
Surround you with the walls of happiness
And dry the tears you've cried

And baby, baby
When sorrow pounds your door
Ooh baby, baby
You can depend on me
To love you that much more
Baby, baby

And baby, baby
Surely you can see
Ooh baby, baby
So much you up to me
Love and ecstasy
Feeling thrilling

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Need you
Love you
