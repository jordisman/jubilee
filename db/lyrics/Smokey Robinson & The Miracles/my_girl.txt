I've got sunshine on a cloudy day, yes, I have
And when it's cold outside don't you know
I've got the month of May, oh yeah

I guess you'd say what could make
A man say it feels this way

My girl, don't you know I'm talking 'bout my girl, yeah
Trying to tell the world all about my girl
(My girl, my girl)
My girl
(My girl, my girl)

I've got so much honey, all the bees have to envy me
Don't you know I've got a sweet song
Than any bird that sings in any tree
Lord have mercy, now

I guess anybody, anywhere would have to say
What on earth could make
A man say he feel this way

My girl, don't you know I'm talking 'bout my girl, yeah
Trying to tell the world all about my girl
(My girl, my girl)
All about my girl
(My girl, my girl)

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh

I don't need no money, I don't need no fortune
Or no fame, no, no, no
I've got all the riches, baby, that one man
Could ever want to claim, yes, I am now

I guess anybody will have to say
What on earth could make a man
Come out and say he feel this way

My girl, don't you know I'm talking 'bout my girl, yeah
I'm trying to tell the world all about
(My girl)

Lord, have mercy, talkin', talkin' 'bout
(My girl)
Ooh
(Talkin, talkin 'bout)
(My girl)

Don't you know I'm talking about my girl, yeah
