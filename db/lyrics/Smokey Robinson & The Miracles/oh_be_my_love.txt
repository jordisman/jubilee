Love's a puzzle, love's a puzzle
Confusing as can be
But work it out and you'll discover
The beauty of love's mystery

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in somehow

Jagged edges such as heartbreak
Can drive you out of your mind
They don't seem to fit
But, oh, don't you quit cause
They're part of love's design

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in somehow

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in come, now

Oh, be my love
Come let the work begin
Be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Be my love
We'll fit the pieces in ooh
