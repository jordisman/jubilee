Oh, I don't want you to go
Oh, please don't leave me alone
Oh
No, I don't want you to go
Oh, please don't leave me alone
Oh
Dear Annett
Soon I'll be with you before they know
Before the show
I'm not a whore, I dance no more
I'll be with you across the border, dearest Anastasia
I'm leaving soon. I'm sorry to
But burn this letter, burn my picture
They won't know I've crossed the border
Love, Victor

Oh, I don't want you to go
Oh, don't leave me alone
Oh
