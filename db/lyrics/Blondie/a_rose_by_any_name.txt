Black and red look so good on you
And your walk makes me believe you
Lipstick, rings are on my fingers
Want the night to always linger
Linger, linger, linger

[Chorus:]
If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name

If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name (by any name)
A rose by any name (by any name)
A rose by any name (by any name)
A rose by any name

Smoking cigarettes in bed
All the same, what will they get?
In the streets they'll never know
Mysteries will never show (show)
Show, show, show, show, show, show, show, show

[Chorus:]
If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name

If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
A rose by any name

(Want the night to always linger)

[Chorus:]
If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name
If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name

If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name
If you're a boy or if you're a girl
I love you just the same
Wherever you go, all over the world
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
A rose by any name
