Cheap china shoes
Tight on my feet
All man-made fabric
Worn out and beat
Pacing the floor
Walking the street
You fly over Brooklyn
Back in a week

I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth a good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line

Love in the head
Taking beach on a bike
All paper players going on strike

I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth a good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line

I'm flat on my back
I'm allergic to love
My rate of recovery is not fast enough
With time on my hands I'm waiting to hear
Our last night in Chelsea
Where it seems like years

I left a note on the back page of your book
Volumes away but it's worth the good look
Remember me, remember that you're mine
Remember me when you get to the last line
