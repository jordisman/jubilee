Don't look in here, yeah
Sundown finds him out of town on the overpass
His inner self glued to his point twenty-two
Dirty metal in the speed of night, lights and broken glass
My heart can destroy all I see
Moving streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can hide us far from sight, but you must wait and I must fight this nothingness
Walls, I see my little room
I hear my parent's friends
I hope that my actions make amends
I would like to kill for love but I don't know how
Here I lie so high above the crowd
Busy streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only

I can move us through the night, but you must wait and I must fight this emptiness
Black top burns with silent screams
Others stop my dreams
Lightning Crash! Crash! Crash!
Fear causes some to live, others die real cool
I died in the evening after school
Be mine only
Be my own
Be mine only
Be my own
