LOOK OUT, Cause there's something wrong
And you don't know what it is
WATCH OUT, Or it's Sodom and Gommorah
The malevolent order
RIGHT NOW, Before it's much too late
Before it's much too late

A dark light---A darkness never ending
A dark light---The devil gets his due
A dark night---Is everywhere descending
A dark light---Is coming for you

NOW LOOK UP, Well the skies are black
And they're getting darker all the time
WATCH OUT, For the things that you believe in
You're gonna be attacked,
and you won't know what it is
WISE UP, You better watch your step
You better watch your step

A dark light---A darkness never ending
A dark light---Of perversion and hate
A dark night---Is everywhere descending
A dark light---There's no time to wait

LOOK OUT, For the death of love
There will be no more love
WATCH OUT, It's yourself that you are fooling
Who do you think you're fooling
SHOUT IT OUT, It's a terrible thing
Such a terrible thing

A dark light---A darkness never ending
A dark light---The sun is turning cool
A dark night---Is everywhere descending
A dark light---Is shining at you

Dark light, Dark light
Is shining at you, Dark light
