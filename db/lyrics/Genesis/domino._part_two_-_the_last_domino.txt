Blood on the windows
Millions of ordinary people are there
They gaze at the scenery
They act as if it is perfectly clear
Take a look at the mountains
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood.
The liquid surrounds me
I fight to rise from this river of hell
I stare round about me
Children are swimming and playing with boats
Their features are changing
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.

Now see what you've gone and done.
Now see what you've gone and done.

Well now you never did see such a terrible thing
As was seen last night on T.V.
Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again
Such a terrible thing to see - oh
But there's nothing you can do when you're next in line
You've got to go domino.

Now I'm one with the living and I'm feeling just fine
I know just what I gotta do
Play the game of happiness and never let on
That it only lives on in a song - oh
Well there's nothing you can do when you're next in line
You've got to go domino.

Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you've begun?

In silence and darkness
Hold each other near tonight
For will it last forever?
Will it last forever - forever...

There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line
You've got to go domino.

Do you know, do you know, do you know what you have done
Do you see what you've begun?
Cos there's nothing, nothing, nothing
There's nothing you can do, there's nothing you can do
Do you see, do you see what you have done?
