Go away; can't you see I'm cryin'?
Go back to the new love that you've found.
Don't sweet talk me, 'cause I ain't listenin',
And you'll only make things worse by hangin' round. 

I know that I'd be crazy,
If I took you back again.
But this foolish heart of mine,
Might just weaken and give in.
So go away,
I feel much better when you're gone.
For you're the one who made me cry.
Now let me cry alone.
