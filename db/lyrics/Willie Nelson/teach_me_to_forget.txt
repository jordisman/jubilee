You taught me how to love with all my heart with all my soul I trusted you
And now you say we'll have to live apart a thing I don't know how to do
You said someday I'd find somebody new and I'll have not one regret
But stay a while if what you say is true stay and teach me to forget
[piano]
You taught me how to worship you alone and now you say you'll have to go
And people call me on the telephone just to say I told you so
I know now that I only learned to live on the night when first we met
God above will teach me to forgive but stay and teach me to forget
Please stay and teach me to forget
