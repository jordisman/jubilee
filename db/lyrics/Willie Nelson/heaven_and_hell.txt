Well sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes I take it as far as I can and sometimes I don't even go
My front tracks're found for a cold water and my back tracks're covered with snow
Sometimes it's heaven sometimes it's hell sometimes I don't even know
[steel - piano]
Heaven ain't walkin' on a street paved with gold and hell ain't a mountain of fire
Heaven is layin' in my sweet baby's arms hell is when baby ain't there
Well my front tracks're found...
Well sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell sometimes I don't even know
