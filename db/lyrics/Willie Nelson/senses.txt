The sense to see and I saw you walk away 
The sense to feel and I feel lonely everyday 
The sense to hear for I heard you say goodbye 
The sense to taste now I can taste the tears that I cry 
My senses tell me all that I need to know 
It's over but I don't have the sense to let you go 
It doesn't make much sense for me to cry for you 
And if I had any sense at all I'd realize we're through 
But my senses are reacting much too slow 
And it's over but I don't have the sense to let you go 
Yes it's over but I don't have the sense to let you go
