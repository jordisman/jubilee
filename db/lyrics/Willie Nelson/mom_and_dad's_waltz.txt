I'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
I want them I want them to know
How I feel my love is real for my mama and daddy
I want them to know I love them so

[CHORUS:]
In my heart joy tears start cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for mom and pappy and each night
I'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
I want them to know I love them so

I'd fight in wars - do all the chores
For my mama and daddy
I want them to live on - till they're called
I'd work and slave - and never rave
For mama and daddy
Because i know I owe them my all.

[CHORUS]
