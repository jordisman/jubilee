Stop here across the street to your right 
That's where my house lives 
Sometimes I stayed there at night 
But mostly I was on the move 
Business first you know 
And she'd wait there in her lonely room 
But oh that's been so long ago 
She's gone now 
She couldn't stand to be alone 
And now it waits there 
This house that used to be my home 
I never go there cause it holds 
Too many memories since she's gone 
But right there is where 
My house lives all alone

She's gone now...
