Why me Lord what I have ever done to deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do that was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown
Lord help me Jesus I've wasted it so help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so help me Jesus my soul's in your hand
[guitar]
Try me Lord if you think there's a way I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord I can show someone else what I've been through myself
On my way back to you
Lord help me Jesus...
Jesus my soul's in your hand
