When I ran to the store with a penny
And when youth was abundant and plenty
Classify these as good times
Good times

When I rolled rubber tires in the driveway
Pulled a purse, on a string, across the highway
Classify these as good times
Good times

Good times are coming, humming, mmm
Good times are coming, humming, mmm

Go to school, fight a war, working steady
Meet a girl, fall in love, before I'm ready
Classify these as good times
Good times

Here I sit with a drink and a memory
But I'm not cold, I'm not wet, and I'm not hungry
So, classify these as good times
Good times

Good times are coming, humming, mmm
Good times
Good times are coming, humming, mmm
