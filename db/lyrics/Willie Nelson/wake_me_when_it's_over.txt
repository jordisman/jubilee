Gettin' tired now gotta get some sleep now 
Guess I've been worried much too long 
And don't wake me till it's over 
When the need for you is gone 
I was so happy before I loved you 
I'm gonna be like I was before 
And don't wake me till it's over 
When I don't want you anymore 

My mind is gettin' weak now gotta get some sleep now 
I gotta rest my achin' head 
I just wanna lay here just let me stay here 
Till the blues get up and leave my bed 
Good night, darling 
Good night, darling 
Good night forevermore 
And don't wake me till it's over 
When I won't want you anymore 
My mind is gettin' weak now...
