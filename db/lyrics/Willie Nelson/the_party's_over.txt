Turn out the lights 
The party's over 
They say that 
All good things must end 
Call it tonight 
The party's over 
And tomorrow starts
The same old thing again 

But the crazy crazy party 
Never seen so many people 
Laughing dancing 
Look at you you're having fun 
But look at me 
I'm almost cryin' 
That don't keep her love from dyin' 
Misery cause for me the party's over 
Turn out the lights... 

Once I had a love undyin' 
I didn't keep it but I tried 
Life for me was just one party 
And then another 
I broke her heart so many times 
I had to have my parting wife 
I had to have my party 
Why broke her heart so many times 
But one day she said 
Sweetheart the party's over 
Turn out the lights...
