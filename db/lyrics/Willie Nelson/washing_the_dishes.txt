Washing the dishes scrubbing the floors
Caring for someone who don't care anymore
Learning to hate all the things that she once loved to do
Like washing his shirts and never complaining except of red stains on the collars
Ironin' and cryin' cryin' and ironin' caring for someone who don't care anymore
Someday she'll just walk away
