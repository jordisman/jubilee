Well, I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
It's a little like rain but it's a lot like a sunny day

And it's hard to explain but the sound of your name
Don't make music anymore
It's more a sound of a love that I lost one day

It's a little too late
To start thinking about startin' all over
I'd rather stay where I am
I can't take another slam in the mind

I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
But remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mind

I've been runnin' around
Even laughin' at half of the mem'ries
You're not hard to remember
I just have to think of your name

I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
But remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mind
Remember my love, it's the sound that you hear in your mind
