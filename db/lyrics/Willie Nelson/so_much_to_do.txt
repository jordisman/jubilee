My oatmeal tastes just like confetti the coffee's too strong so forget it
The toast is burning well let it there's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone
My tie's lost I can't find the sweater there's the doorbell I hope that's your letter
My head aches I hope I feel better there's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone
So much to do since you've gone too much to do all alone
And time time rolls on like a river and oh there's just so much to do
And I just can't do without you
