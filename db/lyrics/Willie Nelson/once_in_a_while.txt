Once in a while will you try to give one little thought to me
Though someone else maybe nearer your heart

Once in a while will you dream of the moments I shared with you, 
Moments before we two drifted apart.

In love's smoldering ember, one spark may remain, 
If love still can remember the spark may burn again.

I know that I'll be contented with yesterday's memory, 
Knowing you think of me once in a while.
