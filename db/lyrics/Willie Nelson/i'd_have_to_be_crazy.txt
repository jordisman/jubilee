I'd have to be crazy
to stop all my singing
and never play music again.

You'd call me a fool
if I put on a top hat
and ran out to flag down the wind.

I'd have to be weird
to grow me a beard
just to see what the rednecks would do.

I'd have to be crazy
plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you.

You know I
(and I don't intend to)
But should there come a day,
when I say that I don't love you
They'll lock me away ay ay.

It sure would be weird
to live in an envelope
waiting along for a stamp

You'd swear I was loco
to rub for a genie
while burning my hand on the lamp

And I may not be normal
but nobody is
so I'd like to say 'fore I'm through

I'd have to be crazy
plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you
