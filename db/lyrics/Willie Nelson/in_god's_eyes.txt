Never think evil thoughts of anyone 
It's just as wrong to think as to say 
For a thought is but a word that's unspoken 
In God's eyes He sees it this way 
Lend a hand if you can to a stranger 
Never worry if he can't repay 
For in time you'll be repaid ten times over 
In God's eyes He sees it this way 
In God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow 
Now and then a lamb goes astray 
But open arms should await it's returning 
In God's eyes He sees it this way

In God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow 
Now and then a lamb goes astray 
But open arms should await it's returning 
In God's eyes He sees it this way
