Sweet is the song when the song is love love that has stood the test of time 
And when you've heard all the songs of love will you remember mine 
Gone are the times that I walked with you and held your hand in mine 
Now when you hold another's hand will you remember mine 
I have sat 'neath the trees while the cool summer breeze 
Blew away the sands of time 
And thought of days when you were near remembering when you were mine 
Gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine 
Now when you kiss another's lips will you remember mine 
I have sat neath the trees...
