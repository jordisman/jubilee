I'll walk alone 
Where once we wandered 
It seems so strange 
Since you are gone 
Till you return 
I'll stay the same, dear 
I'll still be true 
And walk alone 

By stars above 
I swear to love you 
With all the love 
I've ever known 
While we're apart 
I'll stay the same, dear 
And when teardrops start 
I'll walk alone 

[piano]

The flame of love 
Is brightly burning 
And you know that I'm 
Your very own 
Each night I pray 
For your returning 
But while you're gone 
I'll walk alone
