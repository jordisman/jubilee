I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends, right?

You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
You don't want me in the flat when you're home at night
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between
Nicki's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?

I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
You want me to suffer just cause you were born white
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
It's easy to smoke it up and forget
Everything that happened in between

I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I want to smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla and you get the draw

Because we are best friends, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends, right?
Because we are best friends, right?
