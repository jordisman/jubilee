Say "you", say "me",
Say it for always. That's the way it should be.
Say "you", say "me",
Say it together, naturally.

I had a dream,
I had an awesome dream:
People in the park
Playing games in the dark.
And what they played
Was a masquerade.
From behind the walls of doubt
A voice was crying out,

Say "you", say "me",
Say it for always. That's the way it should be.
Say "you", say "me",
Say it together, naturally.

As we go down
Life's lonesome highway,
Seems the hardest thing to do
Is to find a friend or two.
That helping hand,
Someone who understands
That when you feel you lost your way
You've got someone there to say.
I'll show you.

Say "you", say "me",
Say it for always. Oh, that's the way it should be.
Say "you", say "me",
Say it together, naturally.

So, you think you know the answers.
Oh, no.
Well, the whole world's got you dancing.
That's right. I'm telling you.
It's time to start believing.
Oh, yes.
Believing who you are.
You are a shining star.

Say "you", say "me",
Say it for always. Oh, that's the way it should be.
Say "you", say "me",
Say it together, naturally.

Say it together, naturally.
