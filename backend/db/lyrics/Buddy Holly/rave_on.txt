Well, the little things you say and do
Make me want to be with you-ou-ou
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
When you say I love you
Rave on

The way you dance and hold me tight
The way you kiss and say good ni-i-ight
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
When you say I love you
Rave on

Well, rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad that you're revealin' your love for me

Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me not to be lonely
Tell me you love me only
Rave on to me

Well, rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad that you're revealin' your love for me

Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me not to be lonely
Tell me you love me only
Rave on to me
