All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

All of my life, I've been waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and the shadows are fallin'
You can hear my heart a-callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

(Dum de dum dum, oh boy!)
(Dum de dum dum, oh boy!)

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

All of my life, I've been waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and the shadows are fallin'
You can hear my heart a-callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!)
The world can see that you were meant for me
