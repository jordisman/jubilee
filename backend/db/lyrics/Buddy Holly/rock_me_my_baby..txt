Put your arms around me now
And try your best to squeeze me
Love me baby - you know how
Yes, a-rock me my baby

Well, rock a-like a hockory-dock, dickory-dock
Rock-a-bye my baby
Up and down - around the clock
Well, a-rock me my baby

Plant your kisses on my lips
And make me bubble brightly
Thrill me to my fingertips
Well, a-rock me my baby

Tell me that you love me too
And say you'll never me
No one loves you like I do
So rock me my baby
