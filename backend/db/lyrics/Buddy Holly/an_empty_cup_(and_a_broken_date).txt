One lonely night at this drive-in
And now I know what a foo-ooll I've been
She was to meet me, we had a da-ate
A date at seven I dreamed of heaven
Now it's way past eight
She just drove by with another guy
No wonder I can't he-elp but cry

To think she never cared just tears me up
Now all I have to show for love
Is this empty cup
Just like this Coke
My love is gone I've hit the bottom
Now I'm all alone
