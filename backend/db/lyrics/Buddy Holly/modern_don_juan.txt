Well, I ain't nothin' but a man in love
I ain't nothin' but a man in love
The girls they say, I'm their only one
They say I'm a modern Don Juan

Well there ain't but one thing puzzlin' me
I got a girl and she can't see
That I want only to make her mine
Well she thinks I'm just handin' her a line

Oh, I love her so, I'll never ever let her go-o-hoh

I ain't nothin' but a man in love
I ain't nothin' but a man in love
The girls they say, I'm their only one
They say I'm a modern Don Juan

Oh, I love her so, I'll never ever let her go-o-hoh

I ain't nothin' but a man in love
I ain't nothin' but a man in love
The girls they say, I'm their only one
They say I'm a modern Don Juan
Well, I ain't nothin' but a man in love
I ain't nothin' but a man in love
I ain't nothin' but a man in love
