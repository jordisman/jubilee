Send me some loving, send it I pray
How can I love you when you're far away

Send me your picture, send it my dear
So I can hold it, pretend you are near

Can't you send me your kisses, I can feel their touch
I need you so badly, I miss you so much

My days are so lonely, my nights are so blue
I'm here and lonely, I'm waiting for you

Can't you send me your kisses, I can feel their touch
I miss you so badly, I need you so much

My days are so lonely, my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely, I'm waiting for you
