Here today, gone later today.
I’ve been reading what the bloggers say.
How about a great big slice for me?
Otherwise or professionally.

Beats workin’.
Startin’ up in my feet.
Goes to workin’ 
on the rest of me.

Live this life of luxury 
sho-nuff beats workin’ for me.
Kid’ll land on his feet 
if he don’t land on his seat.

This beats workin’ baby
‘cause I’m red hot
baby like it or not.

Don’t you know that
this beats workin’ baby
‘cause I’m red hot
baby like it or not.

One empty floor
stands between the stage
and the welfare door.

Heads or tails
of the same bread.
Coin of the realm 
just like the man said

Beats workin’.
Starting up all in my feet.
Goes to workin’ 
on the rest of me.

Got a feelin’ all in my head.
Try to do it
like the good book said.
Kid’ll land on his feet 
if he don’t land on his head.

This beats workin’ baby
‘cause I’m red hot
baby like it or not.

Don’t you know that
this beats workin’ baby
‘cause I’m red hot
baby like it or not.

This beats workin’ baby.
This beats workin’ baby.
This beats workin’ baby
‘cause I’m red hot
baby like it or not.
