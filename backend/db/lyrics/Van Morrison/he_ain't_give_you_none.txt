Little girl, little girl, Lord, you know it's true
Little girl, little girl, Lord, you know it's true, now
I don't wanna stop, rockin' and rollin' with you

Are you gonna, let me stand a-lone, now?
Are you gonna, let me stand a-lone, now?
Caught you this mornin'
Before your daddy came home

An I done more for you
Than your daddy has ever done
I done more for you
Than your daddy has ever done
Give ya my jelly roll
And he ain't give ya none

Let's go, Eric

[instrumental and guitar solo]

Don't you ever go down
Down on Curzon Street, it's bad
Don't you ever go down
Down on Curzon Street
That's where old John
Flogs his daily meat

Maybe sometime he say leave-a
Little boy, an li'l girl behind
I got messed up 'round somewhere
Called Notting Hill Gate

I lived up there for a while
But I moved out
And when I moved out I was in such a state
Ain't never goin' back there

But I'm, I'm sure I've done more for you
Than your daddy has ever done, baby
Made you learn you syllables

Done more for you
Than your daddy has ever done, oh Lord, ha-ha
Give ya my jellyroll
He ain't give ya none
Stay on the move

In the back street
In the back street I give you my jellyroll
Oh, I give it to ya, ha-ha

Ya 'member when we were down in the, the alley
And I said, 'The lights are out, baby this is it, ya know'?
Ha-ha-ha
Alright, we got a good thing goin'

You can leave now
If ya don't like what's happenin'
You know like we got, ha
A few things goin', you know, ha-ha
Ah-ha, it's a drag, ha-ha
Ah-huh, that's what you call it

[Fades]
It's the name of the game.
