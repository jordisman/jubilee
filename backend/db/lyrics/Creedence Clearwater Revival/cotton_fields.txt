[Chorus 1:]
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle,
In them old cotton fields back home;

[Chorus 2:]
It was down in Louisiana,
Just about a mile from Texarkana,
In them old cotton fields back home.

[Chorus 3:]
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton,
In them old cotton fields back home.

[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
