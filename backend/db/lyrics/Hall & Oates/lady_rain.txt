[Chorus:]
Lady Rain, lay your sobbin' hair down on my shoulder
Lady Rain, do your cloudy eyes see me much older?

Can you see my past
Can you find my future
Should I take it slower 'til my life is over
Oh Lady Rain... is it I'll be going down in pain?

[Chorus:]
Lady Rain, lay your sobbin' hair down on my shoulder
Lady Rain, do your cloudy eyes see me much older?

All the days I've lost hoping and pretending
That my days would flow smooth and slow toward their ending
Oh Lady Rain... is it I'll be going down in pain?
