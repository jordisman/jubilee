My friends wonder why
I call you all of the time
What can I say
I don't feel the need
To give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help
No, I know I'm right. Alright
I'm just better off
Not listening to friends' advice
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know
What the reason is
I only smile when I lie
Then I tell them why

(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss
When I turn out the light

I go crazy wondering
What there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time
'Cos it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing
I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done
Regret you
I couldn't go on
But if you insist
On knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know
What the reason is
I'll only smile when I lie
Then I'll tell you why

(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss
When I turn out the light

[Instrumental Interlude]

I really miss you babe

(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
Oh, man (Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss
When I turn out the light
(Because your kiss) your kiss
Is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
