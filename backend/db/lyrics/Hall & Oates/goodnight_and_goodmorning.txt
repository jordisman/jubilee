Funny how the times can change as fast as we can run
Sad to say we had to part when the fun had just begun
Now he night is over
And I'm waiting for the day we can be together
And we can say Goodnight and Goodmorning
From the Dark to the Dawning

I can't believe that I'm in love and you're the one
I can hear a song of love and our song has just begun
When the music's over and we finally walk away
We can walk together
And we can say Goodnight and Goodmorning
From the Dark to the Dawning
