Oh, no, stop bitching indiscretion
You're such an A-1 lover, since when are you perfection
Never true blue to me, so why are you getting nasty
Well, it's lucky for you that I'm gonna keep dancing
Oh, I know

Everyone you do is perfect
Everyone you know is perfect
Everywhere you go is perfect
So on and so on

But you've gotta lotta nerve when you talk about love
If you've gotta lotta nerve we can talk about love
Oh, you've gotta lotta nerve to be talking about love
Yeah, you gotta lotta nerve 'til we talk about love

Listen to you ... your roots will be showing
Better watch what you say and do
Or da cool you'll be blowing
We're talking 16 tones of nerve-a
We're talking perfect nerve
