Thank you for walking
Thank you for spending one day,
with a stranger

Good morning. Hello! Choose a color, carnation
we'll walk along.

Down round the pond, up the hill bricks and steeples
it's not all gone... I recall

Thank you for walking
Thank you for spending one day,
with a stranger

Thank you for talking
and showing the way to a stranger

Wining and dining (what a September)
from bags by the river (I should've  worn a sweater)
a sun, sail, song (it's cooler up here)

We sat on a wall (oh my)
rest our feet (just a little longer)
touch our noses

Then slow poke on... oh, I recall

One red carnation
the color for April
and apples
and wine

I suppose it was white... but I needed the rhyme.

As I packed up to leave oh, I noticed the fountain,
the statue's hand.

There in her bronzed, moistened, palm
red carnation
Without you there... I recall
