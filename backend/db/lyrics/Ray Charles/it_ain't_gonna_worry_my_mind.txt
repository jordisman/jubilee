It's the same old story that they all hand me
The preacher tells me these are troubled times
But I know the Lord's been in tougher scrapes then this one
Ain't gonna worry, ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Got no money in the pocket
You don't get rich working overtime
But as long as you can't buy the springtime in Virginia
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Love is all that ever makes you richer
Oh well, if the truth be told
Moonlight's been my only silver
And the sunlight's my only gold, mm hmm

So go on wishin', go on prayin'
Go on sayin' I'll hit better times
How in the world could you love me any better?
Ain't gonna worry
I tell ya I ain't gonna worry no, no more
Ain't gonna worry my mind
