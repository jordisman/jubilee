(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue

You know a tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss these teardrops
But I missed you constantly

That's why I'm
(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor
You know they were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door

I said a tear fell when you told me
That the flame in your heart died
Darlin', have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes

You know I'm just a
(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

I said a tear fell when you told me
That the flame in your heart died
Darlin', have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes

I've got to be a
(A fool am I)
But I'm so glad I'm a fool
(A fool am I in love)
I'm a fool in love
