Maggie dear, just won't go out alone
Seems that she must have a chaperone
When we go out no matter where we're bound
There's always somebody around

She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her brother
Woah, I never see Maggie alone
She brings her uncle, her cousin
She's got â€˜em by the dozens
You know that's why I never see Maggie alone

And if I phone her, say to her "Sweet, 
Where shall we meet, supposing we eat."
She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her brother
Oh! I can never, never see my Maggie alone

She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her big big brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone
One night when we were out walking
And she got tired of talking
She invited me up to her home

I turned the lights down, they were too bright
Oh! What a sight when I turned on the light
There was her father, her mother
Her sister and her big, fat brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone

I bought a roadster, two-seated
I even had it heated
So that I could see Maggie alone
While we were riding, and kissing
The engine started missing
And we were a long way from home

I got right out and then fast as I could
Found what was wrong, for when I raised the hood
There was her father, her mother
Her sister and her big, fat brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone

I never
Oh I never
Ow, I never see my little Maggie alone
Oh, Maggie
