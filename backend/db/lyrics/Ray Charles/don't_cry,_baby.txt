[Chorus:]
Dont cry, baby
Dont cry my little baby
Dry your eyes lets be sweethearts again

Mhh you know I didnt mean
To ever treat you so mean
Come on sweetheart lets try it over again

[Solo Piano]

[Chorus]

Ahhhhh I know you know I didnt  mean
To ever treat you so mean
Why dont you come on sweetheart lets try it over again
