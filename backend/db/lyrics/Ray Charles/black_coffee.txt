I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor an' watch the door
In between I drink 
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down room
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room.

Been talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock â€˜til four 
An' Lord how slow the moments go
When all ya do is pour 
Black coffee 

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night 
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight
Black coffee 

Feelin' low as the ground
I'm  waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night 
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight 
Black coffee 

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy!
Just waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.
Please come around 
Please come
