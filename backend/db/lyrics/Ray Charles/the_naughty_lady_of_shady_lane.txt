The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has hit the town like a bomb
The back-fence gossip ain't been this good
Since Mabel ran off with Tom

Our town was peaceful and quiet
Before she came on the scene
The lady has started a riot
Disturbin' the suburban routine

I mean that naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Me-oh my-oh, what a girl

You should she how she carries on
With her admirers galore
She must be givin' them quite a thrill
The way they flock to her door

She throws those come-hither glances
At every Tom, Dick and Joe
When offered some liquid refreshments
The lady never, never says no

The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has the town in a whirl
I mean the naughty lady of Shady Lane
Me-oh my-oh, what a girl

The things they're trying to pin on her
Won't hold much water, for sure
Beneath the powder and fancy lace
There beats a heart sweet and pure

She just needs someone to change her
Then she'll be nice as can be
If you're in the neighborhood, stranger
You're welcome to drop in and see

The naughty lady of Shady Lane
So delightful to hold
So delectable
Quite respectable
And she's only nine days old
