As I walked down this old lonely street
Well it seems like No one seen to wanna speak
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

All the world seem cold, everything is gray
Nothin' seems the same since you went away
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Oh why can't I be set free

All I want is you, all I need is you
But somehow I know that this just can't be
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Oh why can't I be set free

All I want is you, all I need is you
But somehow I know that this just can't be
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
