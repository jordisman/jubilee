Late at night when it's dark and cold
I reach out for someone to hold
When I'm blue, when I'm lonely
She comes through

She's the only one who can
My baby grand is all I need

In my time I've wandered everywhere
Around this world, she would always be there
Any day, any hour
All it takes

Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's been good to me
Alright?

(Alright)

I've had friends, oh, but they've slipped away
And I've had fame, but it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes, spent them fast enough
As for women

They don't last with just one man
But my baby grand is gonna stand by me

Oh, they say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
(What? I don't believe that)
They said melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these, played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far from the life I strayed in
And I've got the scars from those dives I played in

Now I'm home and I'm weary
And in my bones

Every dreary one night stand
My baby grand is coming home with me, with me
Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's been good to me
