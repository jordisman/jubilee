I'm in heaven when I see you smile
Smile for me, my Diane
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane

You have lighted the road leading home
Pray for me (my Diane) when you can (my Diane)
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane

(Smile for me, my Diane)

But no matter wherever I may roam (wherever I roam)
Smile for me, my Diane
