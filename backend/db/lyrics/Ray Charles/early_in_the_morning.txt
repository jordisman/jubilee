Early in the morning and I can't get right, now
Had a little date with my baby last night, now

And it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Hey, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

Well it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
And I know it's early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
Early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to her girlfriends house, but she was out
I knocked on her fathers door and he began to shout, "Get away from here boy"

Yes, early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to Dooky Chase's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me and said, "Ray, you sure look beat"

Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
I told 'em it was in the morning, now (early in the morning)
Yeah, early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Yeah, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I had a lot of money when I started out
Can't find my baby now my money run out, now

Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning)
Whoa, it's early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning)
Yeah, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning, yeah)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues, now
