In the evenin', in the evenin', Mama when the sun go down
In the evenin', darlin', I declare when the sun go down
Yeah, it's so lonesome, it's so lonesome, sometimes
I declare when the one you love is not around
When the sun go down

Last night, I were layin' sleepin'
I declare, I was sleepin' all by myself
Last night, I were layin' sleepin', darlin'
And I declare it was all by myself
Yeah but the one that I was really in love with
I declare she was sleepin' some place else
When the sun go down

Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
And I just, suddenly I wanted baby
Everybody could have a good time before me
When the sun go down

The sun rises in the east
And I declare it sets way over in the west
Sun rises in the east, darlin'
And I declare it sets way over in the west
Yes it's so hard, it's so hard to tell
I declare which one that'll treat you the best
When the sun go down

So goodbye, old sweethearts and pals
Yes I declare I'm goin' away
I may be back to see you again
Little girl some old rainy day
Yes in the evenin', in the evenin'
I declare when the sun go down
When the sun go down
