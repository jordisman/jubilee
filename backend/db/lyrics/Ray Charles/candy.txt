(Candy, Candy)
(It's gonna be just dandy, dandy)

Candy
I call my sugar Candy
Because I'm sweet on Candy
And Candy, she's sweet on me (she's sweet on me)

She understands me
My understanding Candy
And Candy's always handy
When I need sympathy (Need sympathy)

Oh, I wish that there were four of her
So I could love that much, that much more of her
She has taken my complete heart
And I've got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine (make her all mine)

Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine, all mine

The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine
(Candy's all mine)
