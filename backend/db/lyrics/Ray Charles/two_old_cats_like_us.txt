[Charles:] Hey, I like to do a little rockin'
[Williams:] Ray, I get a little rowdy myself
[Williams:] See if you can sing the high part, brother
[Charles:] Hank, I can if you give me some help

[Both:]
'Cause we're the kind when we set our minds
We're gonna do it or bust
Hey, we ain't half bad for two old cats like us

[Williams:] There ain't nothin' like honky tonk music
[Charles:] Now
[Williams:] When you get an itching to play

[Charles:] And singing those songs like 'Hey, Good Lookin'
[Charles:] And 'Baby, Tell Me What I Say'
[Williams:] That'll work

[Both:]
We can take it to the limit
Or take it back to the bus
Ain't no problem for two old cats like us

We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
Ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Play a little

[Williams:] Now this younger generation, Ray
[Williams:] Is keepin' us on our toes
[Charles:] That's right
[Charles:] Playing everything from western swing
[Charles:] To that good ol' rock and roll

[Both:]
And here we are smack dab in the middle
But I think we can adjust
Hell, there ain't nothing new for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Tell the truth, now

[Both:]
We've been down a whole lot of alleys
Shook a whole lot of cans
There ain't too much about prowlin' or howlin'
That we don't understand
Had a few doors slammed on our tails
We've been kicked and cussed
But everything's cool for two old cats like us
But everything's cool for two old cats like us

[Williams:] Let's go prowlin'
[Charles:] Alright
