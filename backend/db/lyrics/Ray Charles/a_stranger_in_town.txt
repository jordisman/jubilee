There's A New Kid In Town
We're looking for the king, the new Messiah
We're following the star shining brighter.
"Old man, won't you help us if you can,"
He shook his head but he pointed his hand.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.

I see you've traveled far bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for the new King's pleasures
I've heard that a king might come
But up till now there hasn't been one.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.

There's a new kid in town,
And he's lying in a manger down the road.
There's a new kid in town,
But he's just another baby I suppose,
Heaven knows,
There's a new kid in town,
Here in Bethlehem.
