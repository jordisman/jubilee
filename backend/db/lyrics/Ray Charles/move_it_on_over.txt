Came in last night at half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
Get it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over little dog 'cause the big dog's moving in

She's changed the lock on our front door
My door key don't fit no more
So get it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over good dog 'cause the bad dog's moving in

This dog house here is mighty small
But it's better than no house at all
So skid it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over old dog 'cause a new dog's moving in

Now listen here pup, before you whine
That side's yours and this side's mine
So shove it on over (move it on over)
I said move it on over (move it on over)
Move over cold dog 'cause a hot dog's moving in
Move over skinny dog 'cause a fat dog's moving in
Move over cold dog 'cause a hot dog's moving in
Let's go home
