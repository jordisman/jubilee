[News reporter:]
The garage is watered from the sprinklers. It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head. The head, which of this time, has no name.

[The Kurgan:] I know his name.

Here I am,
I'm the master of your destiny.

I am the one, the only one,
I am the god of kingdom come.
Gimme the prize,
Just gimme the prize.

Give me your kings,
Let me squeeze them in my hands.
Your puny princes,
Your so-called leaders of your land:

I'll eat them whole
Before I'm done.
The battle's fought
And the game is won.

I am the one, the only one,
I am the god of kingdom come.
Gimme the prize,
Just gimme the prize.

[The Kurgan:]
Now you die.
I have something to say: It's better to burn out than to fade away.
There can be only one.

Move over! I said move over!

Hey, hey, hey, clear the way!
There's no escape from my authority.

I tell you:

I am the one, the only one,
I am the god of kingdom come.
Gimme the prize,
Just gimme the prize.

I am the only one,
I am the god of kingdom come.
Gimme the prize.

[Connor MacLeod:]
There can be only one.
