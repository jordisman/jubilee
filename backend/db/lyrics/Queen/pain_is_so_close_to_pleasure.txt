Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Everybody knows:
One day we love each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time.

When I was young and just getting started,
And people talked to me: they sounded broken hearted.
Then I grew up and got my imagination,
And all I wanted was to start a new relation.

So in love, but love had a bad reaction.
I was looking for some good old satisfaction,
But pain is all I got
When all I needed was some love and affection.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain and pleasure.
Pain and pleasure.

When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,
But inside of your mind you put up a fight.

Where are the answers that we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore.
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad,
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad.

Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better, for worse.
So let's make the best of the rest of our years.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
I told you so.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain and pleasure.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

All your life.
Pain, pleasure.
