Well I'm runnin' through the world with a gun in my back tryin' to catch a ride in a cadillac
Thought that I was livin' but you can't really tell been tryin' to get away from that success smell
You know I need a houseboat and I need a plane I need a butler and a trip to Spain
I need everything the world owes me I tell that to myself and I agree
I'm caught in a dream so what you don't know what I'm goin' through
I'm right in between so I'll I'll just play along with you 
Well I'm runnin' through the world with a gun in my back tryin' to catch a ride in that cadillac
Thought I was livin' but you can't never tell what I thought was heaven turned out to be hell
Whoa whoa when you see me with a smile on my face
Whoa whoa then you'll know I'm a mental case whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I'm caught in a dream so what I don't know what I'm going through
I'm right in between so I'll I'll just play along with you
Whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh aah aah aah aah oo oo oo oo oo oo
