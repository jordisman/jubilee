Here I go again up and down alone all my friends went home years ago
All my toys are broken and so am I inside mom the carnival has closed years ago ooh
I'm a little boy no I'm a great big man no let's be a little boy
For a little while longer maybe an hour no Steven we have to go back now
Isn't that our mom calling Steven Steven Steven come home Steven come home
