Who's the Queen of the lockeroom?
Who's the cream of the crop?
Joey took her to the matine (Joey took her to the matinee)
Thank God she wouldn't stop (Said "God, she wouldn't stop")

Holy muscle of love, my heart's a muscle

Well I must have gone to their crazy head, (well it must have gone to their crazy head)
Where everything is hot.
Cuz I don't know if the things I'm thinkin'
I know the thoughts are not (are normal thoughts or not).

Holy muscle of love, my heart's a muscle

I read Dad's books like I did before,
Now things are crystal clear.
Lock the door in the bathroom now,
I just can't get caught in here.

I got a muscle of love
Holy muscle of love
My heart's a muscle of love
Holy muscle of love
I got a muscle of love
Yeah
Must be a gift from above
