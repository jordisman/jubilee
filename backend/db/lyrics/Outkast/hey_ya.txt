One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door

Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Uh, thank God for mom and dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey, ya [repeat]

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved

If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes, then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception
So why you, why you, why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here

Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey, ya
Hey, ya
Hey, ya
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey, ya
Just want you in my Caddy
Hey, ya
Don't want to meet your mama
Hey, ya
Just want to make you cumma
Hey, ya
I'm, I'm
Hey, ya
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest

Hey, alright now
Alright now fellas yeah!
Now what's cooler than bein' cool?
(Ice cold!)
I can't hear ya'
I say what's, what's cooler than bein' cool?
(Ice cold!)

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

OK now ladies (yeah!)
Now we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me to break this thing down for nothing
Now I wanna see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor

Here we go
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, shake it
Sh you got to, shake it, sh shake it, shake it, got to shake it
Shake it sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Repeating "Shake it" in background:]
Now all Beyonc√©s and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls
Get on the floor
Get on the floor

Shake it like a Polaroid picture, sugar
You know what to do
You know what to do
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
You know what to do!

Hey, ya [repeat]
