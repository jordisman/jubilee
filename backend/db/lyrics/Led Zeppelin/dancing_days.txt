Dancing days are here again
Summer evenings grow
I got my flower
I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright
You know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident in the way you're wearing your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent as the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright
I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion
He was standing alone
The tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart

You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So, dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower
You are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright
You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart

You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is now
