One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three.
One.

Oh, baby, it's cryin' time, 
Oh, baby, I got to fly.
Got to try to find a way, 
Got to try to get away,
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe.

Oh, baby, the river's red, 
Oh, baby, in my head.
There's a funny feelin' goin' on. 
I don't think I can hold out long.

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry,
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, 
Mm, baby, it's just a den
For those who hide, 
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe.

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry,
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?

Baby, how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure.
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore.
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk,
And the boots of those who march,
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago.
