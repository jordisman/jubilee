Operation heartbreak
You took your love from me
And for the rest of my life there will always be
A wound that will never heal, oh, oh, oh

With all I have to give why must I sit and suffer?
Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
Why did you take your love from me? 
(Why did you take your love from me?)

Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
How will I ever survive? Yeah (survive)
For you have made a score deep down inside of me
Without your love I can't stay alive, oh yeah (stay alive)

With all I have to give why must I sit and suffer? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
Why did you take your love from me? (operation, uh)

Operation (operation, uh)
Oh, heartbreak (operation, uh)
Operation (operation, uh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
A wound that will never heal, oh, oh, oh
