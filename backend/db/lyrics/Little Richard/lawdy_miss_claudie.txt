Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy miss Claudie
Girl you sure look good to me
But please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me

'Cause I give you all my money
Yeah but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

Gonna tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear girl what you been doing to me
I'm gonna tell everybody that I'm down in misery

So bye, bye, bye, baby
Gal, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go
