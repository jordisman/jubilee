I'm wonderin'
Do you love me anymore
Oh yeah
I'm wonderin'
Do you love me anymore
Oh yeah

If you love me like I love you
Then we can make all these dreams come true
And I'll be wonderin'
Oh what am I, I'm gonna do
Oh yeah

I cried
Yes I cried over you
Oh yeah
I cried
'Cause you're being
Being so untrue, oh yeah

Now I know you don't love me
You pretend that you do
Now I'm wonderin'
What am I, I'm gonna do
Oh yeah

My heart is so, so full of pain
Oh yeah
And my soul is so, so full of pain
Oh yeah

Now I know you don't love me
You pretend that you do
Now I'm wonderin'
What am I, I'm gonna do
Oh yeah
