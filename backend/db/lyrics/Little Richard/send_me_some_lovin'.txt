Send me some lovin', oh send it I pray
How can I love you, when you're far away?

Send me your picture, send it my dear
So I can hold it, pretend you are here

Can you send me your kisses? I still feel their touch
I need you so badly, I miss you so much

My days are so lonely, my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely, I'm waitin' for you
