I'm all alone
Alone in this world
I'm all alone
And I lost my only girl

I'm all alone
Yes, I need some one to love
I'm all alone
Alone in this world

Once I had a love
[?]
But that love struck me
She up and put me down

I'm just a lonely
A lonely, lonely guy
A lonely guy in this town
Oh, yes
A lonely guy in this town

If my baby
Can't be found
I'm going to the river
Jump overboard and drown

I'm just a lonely
A lonely, lonely guy
I feel so low down
Oh, feel so low down

If my baby
Can't be found
Yes, I'm going to the river
Jump overboard and drown

I'm just a lonely
A lonely, lonely guy
And I feel so low down
Oh, yes, so low down
