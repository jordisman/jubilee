You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window
I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind
He said

Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me

Well, I screamed "Fella, what's wrong with you?
From this day on our romance is through?"
I said "Tell me baby, [?] that you played
How could another man take my place?"
She said

Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me
