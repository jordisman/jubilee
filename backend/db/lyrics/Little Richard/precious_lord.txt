Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, help me stand
Lord, I'm tired, Lord, I'm so weak
Lord, You know I am worn

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

When my way, it gets kind of dreary
Precious Lord, somewhere near
When my light is almost gone

Hear my cry, Lord, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home
