Bad luck baby put the jinx on me,
I got the heeby jeebies and I can't get well,
I got the heeby jeebies and it's you I gotta tell,
If I can't find my baby, then you know darn well,
I'm gonna ring your door till I break your bell.

You gotta jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies,
Gotta get back, get back, heeby jeebies,
Gotta jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies,
Gotta get back, get back, heeby jeebies,
Gotta jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies,
Got my bad luck baby put the jinx on me.

I got the heeby jeebies 'cause I love you so,
I got the heeby jeebies why do you have to go,
If you don't want me, darling, just let me know,
Then I won't be a fool over you know more,
You gotta jump back,...

I got the heeby jeebies and I feel so sad,
I got heeby jeebies why you make me mad,
If you open the door and let me in,
Then I won't say you put the jinx on me again,
You gotta jump back,...
