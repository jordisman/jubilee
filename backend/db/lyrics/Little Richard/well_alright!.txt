Baby, I love you
And you know my love is true
Swim the ocean, gonna fight a tiger
Do anything for you

It's alright, don't you know it's alright?
Each and every day
You can hear me say
It's alright, oh yeah

You've been so good to me, yeah, yeah
And I love your lovely way
I'm moving mountain, gonna stop an airplane
Do anything you say

It's alright, don't you know it's alright?
Each and every day
You can hear me say
It's alright

Baby, baby, baby, it's alright
Don't you know it's alright, oh yeah?
History's alright, don't you know it's alright?
Baby, baby, it's alright
