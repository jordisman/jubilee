Oh, oh, oh, Miss Ann, you're doin' something no-one can,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Miss Ann, you're doin' something no-one can,
Because believin' and deceivin', it's drivin' me to grievin' now.

I wanna hear, hear, hear Miss Ann, I wanna hear her call my name,
I wanna hear, hear, hear Miss Ann, I wanna hear her call my name,
Because she keep callin' loud, but she calls it so sweet and so plain.

Well, I told Miss Ann once, and I told Miss Ann twice,
Yes, I told Miss Ann once, and I told Miss Ann twice,
Boys, when I'm with Miss Ann, I'm livin' in paradise.

If she thinks I'm gonna let her be free, how wrong can Miss Ann be,
If she thinks I'm gonna let her be free, how wrong can Miss Ann be,
I'm in love with Miss Ann, and that's the way it's gonna be.
