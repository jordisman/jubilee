Oh, true fine mama, she's really on the ball,
Yes, true fine mama, she's really on the ball,
She hears my every plea, comes to my beckon call.

Oh, come back baby, don't leave me here,
Woo, come back baby, don't leave me here,
You know that I love you, don't dissappear.

Yes, true fine mama, don't go away,
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away,
You know that I love you, every night and day.

Well, singin'
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey, honey,
Honey, honey, honey.
