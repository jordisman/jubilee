Listen to the rain a-fallin'
Can't you hear that lonesome sound
Oh, my poor old heart is breakin'
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

Lord, I think I'll start to ramble
Got to leave this weary town
This old place is way too lonely
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

On that train tonight I'm leavin'
And don't ask me where I'm bound
I can't stay here any longer
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

Memories come back to haunt me
My dream house has done fell down
This old world is dark around me
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

Something tells me that I'm losing
'Cause these weary blues I've found
Oh, my baby left this morning
Lord, my sweet love ain't around
