Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight
I'm alone and oh, so blue tonight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
May you never be alone like me.

I believed the lies you told to me
When you whispered, "Dear, I worship thee!"
Now here am I alone and blue
All because I loved no one but you.

I gave up my friends, I left my home
When you promised to be mine alone
Now you're gone, our love could never be
May you never be alone like me.

In the bible, God's own words do say
For ev'ry wrong some day you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free
May you never be alone like me.
