Everybody says you let me down
That I should be ashamed to take you 'round
Makes no difference what you used to do;
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you.

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
but together, we can find a brighter way.
In my heart, I know that you'll come through
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known
came the day you said you'd be my own
and it matters not what we go through
Darlin I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past,
and perhaps those memories will always last
even though you proved to be untrue
darlin I could never be ashamed of you.
