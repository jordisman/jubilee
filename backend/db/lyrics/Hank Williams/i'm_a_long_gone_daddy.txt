All you want to do is sit around and pout
And now I got enough and so I'm getting out

I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow

I been in the doghouse so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong

[chorus]

I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight

[chorus]

You start your jaws a-wagging and it never stop
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top

[chorus]

I remember back when you were nice and sweet
Things have changed, you'd rather fight than eat

[chorus]

I'm a-gonna do some riding on the midnight train
I'm taking everything except my ball and chain

[chorus]
