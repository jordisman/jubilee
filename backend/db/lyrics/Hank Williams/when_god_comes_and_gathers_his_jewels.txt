The ceremony was over
A lad stood alone in tears
For he had just said goodbye
To the one he had loved thru the years.

He stood all alone with his head bowed down
As though his heart would break
Then the Parson came over and took his hand
And to him these words he did say.

[CHORUS]
When God comes and gathers his jewels
All his treasures of diamonds and gold
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers his jewels.
[Substitute I'll meet her.....on last chorus]

Each night when the pale moon is shining
You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted to'ard heaven
He's repeating these words he was told.

[CHORUS]
