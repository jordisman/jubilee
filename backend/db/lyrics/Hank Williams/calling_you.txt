When you've strayed from the fold
And  there's trouble in your soul
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour  Callin' You?
When your soul is lost in sin
And you're at your  journey's end
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
[CHORUS]
Callin' You?, (Callin'  You?)
Callin' You?, (Callin' You?)
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour  Callin' You?
He will take you by the hand
Lead you to that  promise land
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
As you journey day by day
And temptation  comes your way
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
If you'll  follow in His light
He will always guide you right
Can't you hear the  Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
[CHORUS]
When your soul is burdened down
And your  friend(s) can not be found
Can't you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin'  You?
If you'll follow Him each day
He will brighten up your way
Can't  you hear the Blessed Saviour Callin' You?
[CHORUS]
