Last night as I lay down to sleep
I heard someone began to weep
Then I got up just to see
I heard my mother praying for me

She was kneeling by her bed
And tears of pain were being shed
She said, "Dear God, please hear my plea"
I heard my mother praying for me

I got my Bible and sat down
And in the Holy Book I found
The way to end this misery
Thank God, my mother prayed for me

I read it on into the night
And soon began to see the light
And now at last my soul is free
Thank God, my mother prayed for me
