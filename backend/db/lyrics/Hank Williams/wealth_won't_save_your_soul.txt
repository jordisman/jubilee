AS WE JOURNEY ALONG, ON LIFE'S WICKED ROAD,
SO SELFISH ARE WE, FOR SILVER AND GOLD,
YOU CAN TREASURE YOUR WEALTH, YOUR DIAMONDS AND GOLD,
BUT MY FRIENDS IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.

FOR WHEN GOD CALLS, FROM HIS HOME UP ON HIGH,
TO YOUR EARTHLY WEALTH, YOU MUST SAY GOODBYE,
THEN IT'S USELESS TO YOU, IF YOU'VE STRAYED FROM THE FOLD,
FOR MY FRIEND IT WON'T SAVE YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.

THE RICH MAN LIKE ALL, WILL BE JUDGED AT THAT TIME,
BUT ALL OF HIS WEALTH, WILL BE LEFT BEHIND.
FOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH EARTHLY WEALTH YOU GET HOLD,
WELL MY FRIEND IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.

WHEN THE WORLD IS ON FIRE, ON THAT JUDGEMENT DAY,
FOR ALL OF OUR WRONGS, THEN WE MUST PAY,
BUT THE DEBT CAN'T BE PAID, WITH SILVER AND GOLD,
NO FRIENDS IT WON'T SAVE, YOUR POOR WICKED SOUL.
