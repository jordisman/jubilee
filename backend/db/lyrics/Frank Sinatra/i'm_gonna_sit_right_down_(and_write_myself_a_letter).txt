I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say: "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit (right) down and write myself a letter
(And make believe it came, though I know it's not the same)
And (I'll) make believe (that) it came from you
