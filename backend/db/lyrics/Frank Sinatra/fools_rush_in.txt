"Romance is a game for fools", I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play

"Romance is a game for fools", I said and grinned
Then you passed by and here am I
Throwing caution through the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love
My heart above my head

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart
And let this fool rush in
