It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So, set 'em up, Joe, I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, put another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, can't you make the music easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me
Till it's talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe, I know your gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
But this torch that I found it's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
So, make it one for my baby and one more for the road
The long, it's so long, the long, very long ...
