Black cats creep across my path until I'm almost mad
I must have roused the Devil's wrath 'cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party but the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair

But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
So I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned, sent an Air Mail Special, too
You answer was "Goodbye", there was even postage due
I fell in love just once and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

I've never drawn a sweepstake or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time I'd won but Lady Luck said "No"
And though it breaks my heart I'm not surprised to see you go
Everything happens to me

Everything happens to me
