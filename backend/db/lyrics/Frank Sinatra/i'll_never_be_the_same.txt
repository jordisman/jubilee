I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once used to be

And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart

Though there's such a lot
That a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
