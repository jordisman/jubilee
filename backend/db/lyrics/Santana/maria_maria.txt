Ladies and gents, turn up your sound systems to the sound of Carlos Santana and the G&B, it's The Product of get-away blues from the refugee camp

[The Product G&B:]
Maria, Maria
She remind me of a West Side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living a life just like a movie star
Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said, "See you later."

[Santana:]
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (East Coast)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (West Coast)

[The Product G&B:]
Maria, Maria
She remind me of a West Side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living a life just like a movie star
Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
I said it to the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
(By who?)
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping the days of paradise

[Santana:]
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (North Side)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (South Side)

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (world-wide)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (open up your eyes)

[The Product G&B:]
Maria you know you're my lover
When the wind blows
I can feel you through the weather
And even when we're apart
Still feels like we're together

Maria
She remind me of a West Side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living a life just like a movie star
Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar
Played by Carlos Santana

[Wyclef:]
Put 'em up, yo
Carlos Santana with the refugee camp
Wyclef, Jerry Wonda, Mr. Santana, G&B
Yo, Carlos, man, you're making that guitar cry
