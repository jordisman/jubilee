You find someone and fall in love
You learn to love them as much as life
And then one day, somebody steals their heart away
Oh, such is love, such is life
Oh, such is love, such is life

You find someone that you love so much
That to your heart their touch is life
But one day you find that they gone and left you behind
Oh, such is love, such is life
Oh, such is love, such is life

Oh, love, love, love, love, love is strange
And it's so hard to find someone who really cares
And life, oh well now, life is strange
And it's sometimes so hard to bear, yeah

You find someone who loves you so
That to their heart your touch is life
But you love another who loves some other
Oh, such is love, such is life
Oh, such is love, such is life
