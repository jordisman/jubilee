(love you, love you)
I love you, there’s nothing to hide
It’s better than burning inside
I love you, no use to pretend
There I’ve said it again
I’ve said it, what more can I say
Believe me, There’s no other way
I just love you and will to the end
There I’ve said it again

I tried to drum up,
A frase that would sum up
All that I feel, that I feel for you
But what good are frazes
The thought that amazes
Is you love me and it’s so heavenly
Forgive me, for wanting you so
There’s one thing I want you to know
[?] and that I love you so
Heaven knows when
There I’ve said it again
There I’ve said it again
