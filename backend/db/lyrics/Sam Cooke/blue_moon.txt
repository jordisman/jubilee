Blue moon,
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
You heard me sing a prayer
For someone I really care for

Then suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
Then I heard somebody whisper:
„Please adore me!“ and when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
