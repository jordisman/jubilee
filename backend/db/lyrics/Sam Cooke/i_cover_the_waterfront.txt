I cover the waterfront
I’m watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
I search of my love
And I’m guided by the starlit sky above

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront
I’m watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
I’m watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
I search of my love
And I’m guided by the starlit sky above

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront
I’m watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront
