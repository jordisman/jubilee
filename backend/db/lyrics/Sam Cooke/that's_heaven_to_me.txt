The things that I see
As I walk along the streets
That's heaven to me

A little flower that blooms in May
A lovely sunset at the end of a day
Someone helping a stranger along the way
(That's heaven to me)
That's heaven to me

The feeling I have when I hear a touching prayer
It makes me know, the Lord is somewhere
Even the birds flying around in the air
(That's heaven to me)
That's heaven to me, no

It doesn't have to be a miracle
In order for me to see, I know
The goodness of my, my Savior
Is everywhere to me, woah, woah, woah

Even the children playing in the street
Sing a friendly hello to everyone that they meet
Even the leaves blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out on the tree
(That's heaven to me)
That's heaven to me, woah, woah

Woah woah, woah woah, woah Lord
