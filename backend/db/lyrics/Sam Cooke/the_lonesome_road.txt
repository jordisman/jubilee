look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look up, look up
and see you maker
for Gabriel blows his horn

I get weary toting such a load
traveling down that lonesome road
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on

look up, look up
and see you maker
for Gabriel blows his horn

I get weary toting such a load
traveling down that lonesome road
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
