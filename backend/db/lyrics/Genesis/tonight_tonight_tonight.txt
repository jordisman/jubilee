I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see, ooh but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go, get it away from me.

Cos tonight, tonight, tonight - oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh.

I'm going down, going down, like a monkey, ooh but it's alright
Try to pick yourself up, carry that weight that you can't see,
Don't you know it's alright
It's like a helter skelter, going down and down, round and round
But just get it away from me - oh.

Because tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
We're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh.

I got some money in my pocket, about ready to burn
I don't remember where I got it, I gotta get it to you
So please answer the phone, cos I keep calling, but you're never home
What am I gonna do
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh.

You keep telling me I've got everything, you say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me, but you don't
But now I'm in too deep
You see it's got me so that I just can't sleep
Oh get me out of here, please get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help me get out of here.

I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, ooh but it's alright
It's like a load on your back that you can't see,
Ooh don't you know that it's alright
Just try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go
But just get it away from me
Cos tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
Maybe we'll make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh.

Please get me out of here
Someone get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything, anything
