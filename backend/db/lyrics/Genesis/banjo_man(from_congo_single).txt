Give me a song I know 
Something I can relate to 
People never criticize the way I play 
Show me the way to go 
I need to make a breakthrough 
I don't think that I can wait another day 

It's putting years on me 
I'm a young man going grey
I don't believe that I can wait another day 

This simple melody is all I have 
I make my living that way 
I make good friends that way 

I really can't make no sense of it
As hard as I try 
Is it something I do wrong? 
Please won't you tell me why
The people all seem to like it 
And no one knows about it more than I 

I met a man today 
Who walked in my direction 
Stopped took off his hat
And lit a cigarette 
He listened carefully 
To what I had been playing 
Threw a coin into my hands 
And walked away 

I always play just what they want me to 
Everybody wants the same song 
If only I could do it in my own way 
I'd feel such emotion, emotion, 
Emotion, emotion, 

Give me a song I know 
Something I can relate to 
No one wants to criticize the way I play 
I should just say no
And play them what I want to 
'Cause I don't think that I can wait another day 

It's putting years on me 
I'm a young man going grey
I don't believe that I can wait another day 

This simple melody is all I have 
I make my living that way 
I make good friends that way 
They feel my emotion, emotion, 
Emotion, emotion...
