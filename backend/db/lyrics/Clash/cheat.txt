i get violent when i'm fucked up
i get silent when i'm drugged up
want excitement, don't get none, i go wild

i don't know what can be done about it
if you play the game you get nothing out of it
find out for yourself try bein' a goody goody

you better cheat cheat
no reason to play fair
cheat cheat or don't get anywhere
cheat cheat if you can't win

nobody knows what they are doing
it's beyond your control, an' friday night's a ruin
if you wanna survive you better learn how to lie

don't use the rules
they're not for you, they're for the fools
and you're a fool if you don't know that
so use the rule you stupid fool
