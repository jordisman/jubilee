As sure as anything
As sure as I can be
That 99%, pure as Ivory
I caught the scent, followed the smell of it
Couldn't Ignore
Hey, why did you pick on me?

What's that pretty flower I see?
Tall and wild it waves at me
Mother says it's just a weed
Golden Rod, Golden Rod

Growing Wild, not in the city
Gave me an allergy
And my reaction's, what's gonna happen?
It gets no help from me

I can't explain it
Maybe I shouldn't try to
That old genetic code,
Had a hold on me
We go inside it, ran head long into it
And mothers' warning, useless to me

What's that pretty flower I see?
Tall and wild it waves at me
Mother says it's just a weed
Golden Rod, Golden Rod

Another blonde, not from the city
Gave me an allergy
And you can see me drinking the poison
Taking it happily.

Well you will see me
Drinking the poison, taking it happily.

You're running wild
