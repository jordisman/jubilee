Everyday brings change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new face
Secretly I've been tailing you
Like a fox that preys on a rabbit
I had to get you and so I know
I had to learn your ways and habits

Oooooooooooyou were the catch that I was after
I looked up and I was in your arms
And I know that I was captured

What's this whole world coming to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me with a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it

Ooooooooooomy plan didn't work out like I thought
I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught

What's this whole world coming to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
