We want fun we wanna run
We want fun we gotta run
We want fun get out among the hottest clubs and find some love
Billions of people have heard of me and everyone knows 
the sun rises in the East. 
Not too nice, not too sweet, no-one even talks to me. 
I shake the leaves right off the trees. I'm the bee's greasy knees. 
I shake 'em, I break 'em, I drop 'em from eight miles high, alright

In the past my fate was cast, my social life was limited to Halloween 
and New Years Eve, monotony was killing me, approaching schizophrenia. 
I hit the hot spots every night and ... 
for the first time in my life the bouncers would greet me, 
the doormen would escort me, managers adored me. 
Photographers would follow me begging for a smile; 
"Beast, over here, Beast!" "Here, Beast!" The hat check always said to me, 
"Hiya B, whatcha doin' later?"

We want fun we gotta run
If you need fun get out and run
You need fun for feeling fine
We want fun for feeling fine and find the one ...

Now I'm not bragging. Heaven knows, I spend no more nights alone.

Lucky me, I'm ten foot three and freaky. 
My picture's been reprinted, interviews requested one hundred times a week. 
Believe it, I'm not talking through my teeth ..... 
Are you sure you got it, I mean it, to prove it I'm in the news. 
It's true, it's true, check it out, check it out

He wants her love
She wants love

I take action, get relief, pick a partner, pick a piece, get satisfaction
I am the Beast, I am the Beast

She wants fun
He wants her love

I get satisfaction - I pick up my feet. 
I'm the centre of attraction by staying off the streets

And I want love, get some funk and get some fun
Punks like fun, punks like funk
Funk is fun, we want fun
