My name is Little Caesar
Friends call me LC
My Daddy's named the same
And passed it on to me
I'm the kinda guy who by and by
Who wants to be your friend
I'll make you a happy ending
I loop the loo
I do it good
I've been called alotta names
Some of them obscene
But you think I'm funny
And wonder about me
I don't worry anymore
Get uptight or fear
Back in the days of funny funny
They called me queer
They used to call me
They called me rudely

I'm a love 'em and leave 'em kinda fella
A good time gentlemen
Perform my magic for ya
Then I'll make my plan
When I'm gone you'll feel so low
Obsession outta hand
You'll find I'll linger in your mind
You can't forgive me
You won't forget me
You can't live without me
Can't live without me
You'll find there's not enough
And that you love too much
Can't live with me

You can't live with me
Can't live without me
Just call me Caesar

You can't forgive me
You won't forget me
I'm Little Caesar yeah
