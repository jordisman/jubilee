Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again

I explode with excitement when you're near
To be near you I'll go baby, anywhere
'Cause you thrill me like no one else
I just love ya, love you to death
Love one me, I'll love on you
Loving together, nice thing to do

Can you fee it?
Feel the love

Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again

Over here, over there everywhere
Touch my mind, touch my soul, show me you care
'Cause you thrill me like no one else
I just love ya, love you to death
Love on me, I'll love on you
Loving together, nice thing to do

Touch me, touch me, touch me again
Yeah
Touch me, touch me, touch me again
