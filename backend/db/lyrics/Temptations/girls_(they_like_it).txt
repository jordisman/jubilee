Woo-hoo!

Girls, they like it
When they're number one
Girls, they like it
Really turns them on

When you show a girl some respect
She's gonna give her very best
A whole lotta love, a lotta piece of mind
When you treat her like a queen
You don't need no diamond ring
Give her the things that money can't buy

Girls, they like it
When they're number one
Girls, they like it
Really turns them on
Girls sure like it
When you treat them right
So excited
Long through the night
Girls sure like it

Give a girl [?]
For some homegrown tenderness
She'll be sitting high on top of the world
[?]
Is all you need to keep her vow
Feeling good for a lover's high

Girls, they like it
When they're number one
Girls, they like it
Really turns them on
Girls sure like it
When you treat them right
So excited
Long through the night

And when the sun goes down
And the day is through
Just hold em in your arms
You'll see what your love can do

Girls sure like it
Girls sure like it
Girls sure like it
Girls sure like it

Show 'em that you really care
They'll love that you'll always be there

Girls, they like it
When they're number one
Girls, they like it
Really turns them on
Girls sure like it
When you treat them right
So excited
Long through the night
