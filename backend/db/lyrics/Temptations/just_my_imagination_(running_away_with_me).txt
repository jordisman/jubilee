Ooo
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my 'magination, running away with me
It was just my 'magination, running away with me

(Soon) Soon we'll be married and raise a family. (Oh, yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all. This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my 'magination, once again
Running away with me
Tell you it was just my 'magination
Running away with me

[Paul:] Every night on my knees I pray

Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die. Hmm

(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my 'magination, once again
Running away with me
Oh, tell you it was just my 'magination
Running away with me

I never met her but I can't forget her
Just my 'magination
Ooo yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Running away with me

Ooo, just my 'magination running away with me
She's in my mind and hard to find
Just my 'magination
