Ah keeps slipping away
Ah ooh

Keep slipping, your love keeps slipping
Keep slipping your love keeps slipping away
Keep slipping, your love keeps slipping
Keeps slipping away

Yeah mhm
Is there anybody else?
If it is, don't you keep it to yourself
Tell me now, while I still got my pride left
I'll walk away and ill leave you to yourself
Is there any- (is there any-?)
-body else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself!

I feel a hurt coming on
When were together, I feel like I'm alone
Won't you tell me if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Don't let me live like I just don't belong
No, no
Is there any- (Is there any-?)
Anybody else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself

When we're sleeping here together
Baby you'll always call my name
Now you're saying something different
And things just ain't the same!

Ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da bow!
Ooh wow ooh wow oh!

When I look into your eyes
It's plain to see the doorway to your heart is closed for me
'Cause I know eyes don't lie
So why can't we just end this mystery?
Oh, baby
Is there any- (is there any-?)
Anybody else? (-body else?)
Don't you keep it to yourself

Ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da ba ba da
Ba ba da bow
Ooh wow ooh wow oh

Ah keep slipping away
Ah keep slipping away
