Running away sure ain't gonna help you

Oh girl why won't you talk to me on the phone
Every time I call you disguise your voice
And tell me you're not at home
And girl this cold shoulder you're giving me
I don't understand
Could it be that you've already got yourself a man
If not
Running away sure ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get now
Running away sure ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get

Could it be, could it be
That you're afraid of me
If so I never recall giving you a reason
You know how much I love you
I've overexposed myself
My heart has so much joy
That there is room for no one else
Running away sure ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get
Running away sure ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get
