A tender love we once shared
A joyous love we once cared
Now our love is just a shattered dream
So far away from me you're driftin'it seem
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love more
You once said your love for goes beyond compare
The esctasy we once felt in our hearts we no longer share
And each kiss seem to say farewell my dear
There's nothing left of this love is oh so clear
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love me no more
You just don't love me no more, awww
You don't love me no more
Owwwww baby
I can tell that someone else has taken my place
Though you keep the truth from showing on your face
You think you have me fooled but you don't realize
I can see the truth when I look into your eyes
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more, owwww
IIIIIIIIIII...
I can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more
I, I oh I I can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more
