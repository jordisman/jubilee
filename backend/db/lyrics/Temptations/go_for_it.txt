Now's the time to make your move
You see the light that tunnels through
a wall of darkness, it no longer hides
the golden chance you've been denied.
Go for it. Your dream is out there
Go for it. You can share
All the things that love has for you
You're a child of heavens too
And oh oh oh...
There's someone you've longed to see
in a distant place where you've dreamed to be
arms they are waiting so patiently
a touch can set you free.
And oh oh oh...
Go for it. Love it is here
Go for it. The way it is clear.
All the joys of love that exist
to a loving hand of tenderness
And oh oh oh...
Go for it...
Go for it...
Go for it.
Paradise is waiting for you and me, can't you see.
All the signs of love to set you free, eternally.
Love will take you where you need to be.
Go for it. Love it is here
Go for it. The way, it is clear
Go for it. There's no need to fear
Go for it, a chance is here.
Go for it. The way is clear.
Go for it. Love is here.
