If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones (Watch out, watch out)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones

We're all made with 3 plays apiece...
We're born alone, and we die alone
Why can't we live in-between?

I don't care what goes on in your house when you close your door
If you quit lookin' in my bedroom window, I'll quit lookin' in yours

My Girl came home and she caught me with Alice
And she threw me out the door, nah, nah, nah

But the real reason that she was so mad
Was that she was with Alice before (Say what?!)
(See there? People always doin' that)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Yeah, y'all)
Don'tcha throw no stones (It's a shame)

If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don'tcha throw no stones

...I ain't no fool 

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...
Swapping

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping...

If you're living in a glasshouse 
You don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones 

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping...

I said livin', I said livin'

If you're living in a glasshouse...
