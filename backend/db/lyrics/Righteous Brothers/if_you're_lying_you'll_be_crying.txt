Hey

I'm a man now, been a few
Of loving you and been a few
I don't want myself to be that way
I believe what you tell me, that's why I, I wanna stay

But if you're lying to me, baby
You'll be crying someday
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
And I'll never hurt you, woman (Whoa)
I hope it's gonna stay that way, yeah (Yeah)
Whoa, yeah

All my friends say you put me down
They say you hurt every man in town
I don't care about the other men
But if you hurt me, woman, that's something [?]

So if you're lying to me, baby
You'll be crying someday
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
I said that I'll never hurt you, woman (Whoa)
I hope it's gonna stay that way, yeah (Yeah)
Whoa, yeah

Your big, mean brother wants a [?] side of my head, yeah
Your old man, he'd rather hang instead
Your mama's got a gun, she wants to run me out of town
But I ain't gon' walk, woman, if you want me around

But if you're lying to me, baby
You'll be crying someday
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
I said that I'll never hurt you, woman (Whoa)
I hope it's gonna stay that way, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah

(You'll be crying, crying someday)
Yeah, you'll be crying, pretty lady
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
[?]
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
Yeah, you'll be crying
(You'll be crying, crying someday)
