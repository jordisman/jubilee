I need a girl (Ooh)
A girl to love
Please send a girl (Ooh)
From the heaven's up above
I want to love
I want to call to someone
Oh, I'm closely (Ooh)
There must be a girl (Ooh)
In this world for me
If she is far away (Ooh)
I'll swim every sea
Just to kiss her
Hold her and love her
And whistle tenderly
Whistle, so tenderly

(Love is too strong for any man to harm)
That's why I, I need a girl now
That's to stand by my side
(Love comes to those who have love to give)
I'll give my love for as long as I live

Just send a girl (Ooh)
I'll marry someday
Wish she can hear me (Ooh)
Tell her what I said
I want to love
I, I, I, that's that
I want, I want, I want to be loved (Ooh)

Why don't you come on and send me some phat female now
Yeah, I wanna everybody to know
Gonna rise up and be somebody now
