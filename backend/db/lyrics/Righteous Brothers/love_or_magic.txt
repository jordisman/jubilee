Please tell me, darling
Is it love I feel?
Or is it magic
Baby, that makes it seem so real?
I got to know
Is it love or is it magic
That I feel in my heart for you?

I hope this groovy feeling
Is never gonna stop
If time will change it, baby
I'm gonna turn back the clock
I want to know
Is it love or is it magic
That I feel in my heart for you?

Woah
If it's love, people gonna knock it down
And if it's magic, I don't believe in it
Well, if I'm dreaming, I don't care
Please don't, don't you dare try to wake me
'Cause I'm happy as I can be
Happy as I can be

Please tell me, darling
Is it love I feel?
Or is it magic
Baby, that makes it seem so real?
I got to know
Is it love or is it magic
That I feel in my heart for you?

Woah
If it's love, people don't knock it
And if it's magic, I don't believe in it
Well, if I'm dreaming, I don't care
Please don't, don't you dare try to wake me
'Cause I'm happy as I can be
Happy as I can be

Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
Is it love I feel?
