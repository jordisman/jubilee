Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I move like a cat
Crawl like a rat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane
Drive like a car
Ball like a hound
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy [4x]
