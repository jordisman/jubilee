Tell you, don't love me, baby
You don't love me, I know

You been takin'
Takin' all my money and all my clothes
You been takin'
All my money and my clothes
Well, you told some a your friends
That you was gon' to send me outdo's

Please don't leave me
Please don't never, never, go
Please don't leave me
Please don't never, never, go
Well, I'll loose my mind
Go stone crazy, yes I know
