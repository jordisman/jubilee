Ooh-who, woo-ooo-woo...

Somebody's cryin'
Somebody's cryin' all over my house
I said, somebody's cryin'
Somebody's cryin' all over my house
Well now, the reason why I know
Landlord, the porch light's out

I said, 'Baby, who been drive my automobile?'
I said, 'Baby, who been drivin' my automobile, yeah?'
Well now, they wore out all of my tires
And walked off four of my wheels
Lord

Who-ooo?
Who-ooo-ooo, talk to me
Who-ooo?
Baby, baby talk with me
Well, now I wanna know
Who may your lover be?

Well, baby!
He got cigarette burns all over my steerin' wheel
I said, baby got cigarette burns all over my steerin' wheel
Well now, you know, honey
You gon' get somebody killed

Yeah

Whoa-oooh, whoa-oh
Yea-a-a-a-ay!
You better get-a hold on yourself
Well now, I see yo' sorrow
Don't you admit it to nobody else
Whoa...
