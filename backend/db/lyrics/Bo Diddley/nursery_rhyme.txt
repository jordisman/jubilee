My sister's name is Puuding Tame
They asked if she would stay the same
My brother's name is Little Jack Horner
My mama asked to watch to heat warm them

Sister told papa when he got home
Papa, papa, he sassed and moaned
Papa looked at brother, far in his eyes
Brother started on the hand jive

He called sister, and he called mom
Said, "Look here, look here, what's this going on?"
Everybody had a real surprise
But brother had tears in his eyes

Brother's so scared he couldn't walk
Papa's afraid he could not talk
