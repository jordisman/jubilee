You don't love me, you don't care
You don't want me hangin' 'round here
Hangin' 'round here, hangin' 'round here

Well, I love you, yes, I do
Ain't nothin' in the world wouldn't do for you
I wouldn't do for you, wouldn't do for you
I wouldn't do for you

Yes, I saw you on the street
Tell yo' man, you didn't love me
You didn't love me, you didn't love me
You didn't love me

Yes, I need you, yes, I do
You know, pretty mama what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you, what I'll try for you
What I'll try for you

What I'll try for you
What I'll try for you
What I'll try for you
What I'll try for you
What I'll try for you
