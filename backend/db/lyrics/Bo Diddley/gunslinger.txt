Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Yeh, ah-ha
Yeh, ah-ha

I've got a story I really want to tell
About Bo Diddley at the o-k corral
Now, Bo Diddley didn't stand no mess
He wore a gun on his hip and a rose on his chest

Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Yeh, ah-ha (he must be!)
Yeh, ah-ha (sure 'nuff!)

When Bo Diddley come to town
The streets get empty and the sun go down
Sheriff's standing in the doorway
You know he's so scared to say

Yeh, ah-ha
Yeh, ah-ha
