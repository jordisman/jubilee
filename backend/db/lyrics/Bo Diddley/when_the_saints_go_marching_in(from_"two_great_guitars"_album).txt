Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh, when the sun begins to shine
When the sun begins to shine
Oh, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh, when the horn begins to sound
Oh, when the day of judgment comes
