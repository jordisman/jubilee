The great grand-pappy when the land was young
Barred his do' wit' a wagon tongue
Ooh, ho, ho, ho, ho

When the times got tough and redskins smart
Said his prayers with his shotgun cocked
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, whoa, oh

The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Cooked his grub in a fryin' pan
Picked his teeth with a huntin' knife
He wore the same suit all-a his life
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, a, ay, oh

Twenty-one children, came to be blessed
The old man's house in the wilderness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, a, whoa, oh
Doubt his story if you can

The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, hoo ah, hoo, ow
Whoa, ooh, a, ooh
