If I ever leave you, baby
You can say I told you so
If I ever hurt you, baby
You know I hurt myself as well
Is that any way for a man to carry on?
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't makin' too much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent
Is that any way for a man to carry on
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not tryin' to be
Any kind of man
I'm tryin' to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know that I can be
A part of you that no one else could see
I just gotta hear, to hear you say
It's all right

I'm only flesh and blood
But I can be anything that you demand
I could be President of General Motors, baby
Or just a tiny little grain of sand
Is that any way for a man to carry on
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
Yes, I love you baby, I love you baby
I love you more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

If I ever leave you, baby
You can say, I told you so
And if I ever hurt you, baby
You know, I hurt myself as well
Is that any way for a man to carry on
D'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
I love you baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know
