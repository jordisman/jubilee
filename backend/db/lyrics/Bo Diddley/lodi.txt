Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seeking my fame and fortune, looking for a pot of gold
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through this town, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine said, I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live
Oh! Lord, stuck in Lodi again...
