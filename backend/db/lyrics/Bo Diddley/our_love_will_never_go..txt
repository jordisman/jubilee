One kiss from your lips
Set my soul on fire
The touch of your hand
Drives me wild
Now, I'll know...
Our love will never grow

So darling, as I lay here in my bed
Dreaming and thinking
All the things you said
Now, I know...
Our love will never grow

So give me one chance to prove my love
I'll do anything for you
Your love, I'll love
I, I, I know, our love will never grow

One kiss from your lips
Drives me wild
Sets my soul on fire
