I was down in the jungle picking wild beans
Something jumped up that I never before seen
I picked up my bag and I tried to make a getaway
Chances did I heard somebody say

Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run, ahoo
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run

I was running so fast that I didn't even leave a track
Whatever it is caught me snatched the shirt offa my back
Running through the jungle was such a breeze
Till I shook all the leaves off the bamboo trees

Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run, yahoo
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run

Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run, ahoo
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run

I was running through the jungle with a terrible breeze
I tripped over a stump and I hurt my knees
When the people in the village they saw me running
They didn't know what was going on, they thought things were awfully funny

But I said
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run, ahoo
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run

I was running so fast that I didn't even say goodbye
Sprouted wings on my feet and I began to fly
Flew so far away from that land
Found myself straddled on a United airplane

Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run, ahoo
Run run run, Diddley Daddy
Run run run
