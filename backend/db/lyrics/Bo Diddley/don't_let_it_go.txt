All night and the night before
(Don't let it go)
Somebody kept a-knockin' on the door
(Don't let it go)
Got up and see what the noise
(Don't let it go)
Spot myself a rowdy young boy
(Don't let it go)

Put on my hat, put on my shoes
(Don't let it go)
I ran out the door to see what I could do
(Don't let it go)
They were singin' a song called
(Boo-hoo-hoo)

Look out here come the rhythm boys
(Boo-hoo-hoo)
I was out there shakin' their hands
(Boo-hoo-hoo)
One cat broke out singin', "I'm A Man"
(Boo-hoo-hoo)
Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)

Hold on to what you got but don't let go (yeah, yeah)
(Don't let it go)
Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)

Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)
We've changed the tune and start singin' a song
(Don't let it go)
(Boo-hoo-hoo)
I like yo' woman ain't gon' do no harm
(Boo-hoo-hoo)

I said, "Get away beer boy, your mind's messed up"
(Boo-hoo-hoo)
She bring me my coffee in her favorite cup
(Boo-hoo-hoo)

Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)
Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)
Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)
Hold on to what you got but don't let go
(Don't let it go)

Goin' start to singin', you're singin' in vain
(Don't let it go)
I like a-your woman, it's a cryin' shame
(Don't let it go)
I said, "No, no, no, that won't work, here"
(Don't let it go)
You better go back, grow up, come back next year
(Don't let it go)

She said, "Hold on to what you got but don't let it go"
(Don't let it go)
She said, "Hold on to what you got but don't let it go"
(Don't let it go)
She said, "Hold on to what you got but don't let it go"
(Don't let it go)

(Say, hey)
(Don't let it go)
(Say, hey)
