I'm looking for a woman
That will work to set me down
I'm looking for a woman
That will work to set me down
I've bin looking all night long
She can't be found

Well, I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
Well, I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
She said get away from here country boy
Go back to your countryside

Well, tell me baby
What you see wrong with me
Well, tell me baby
What you see wrong with me
Well, if I had you baby
You wouldn't be lookin' back at me

Well, so long mama
Baby bye-bye you bye
Well, so long mama
Baby bye-bye you bye
Well, now bye-bye baby
With a tear in your eye
