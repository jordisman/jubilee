Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)

Hey little baby, don't you cry
Mama gonna drop around
Hey little baby, don't say a word
Mama gonna whoop you 'bout somethin' you heard

Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)

Mama gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring's brass
Mama gonna buy a lookin' glass
If that lookin' glass is broke
Mama gonna buy a horse and coach
If that horse and coach turn over
Mama gonna buy you a dog named Rover

Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (hush your mouth!)
Oh (Hush your mouth!)

A coonskin alligator hide
Make into shoes baby, jus' like mine
Don't be scared to put 'em on your feet
Scared 'bout me, jus' can't be beat

Hush your mouth
Hush your mouth
