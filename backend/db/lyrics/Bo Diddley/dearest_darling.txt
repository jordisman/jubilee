Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling

Don't you know
The Lord above
Created you
Just for me to love
Picked you out
From all the rest
Because He knew, I loved you best

Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand

I once had a heart
So trill and true
But now it's gone
From me to you
Take care of it
Like I have done
For you have two hearts
And I have none

Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling

If I get to heaven
Before you do
I'll try to make a hole
And pull you through

Dearest... dearest... dearest...

If I go to heaven
And you not there
I'm gonna write your name
On the heavenly stair
If you aren't there
By turn of day
Then I know baby
You know the way

Dearest... dearest... dearest...
O sweet baby, o sweet baby...
