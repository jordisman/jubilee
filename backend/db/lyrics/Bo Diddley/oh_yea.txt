I've got a little woman
She ain't very tall
She says she loves me
Me, best of all

She's my woman
All in all
She's my lover
And she's my ball

I roll around
I have a lot of fun
She always whispers to me, softly
Said, "Bo Diddley, you the one"

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Sho' nuff'

I hold her in my arms
And I kiss her real gentle
She says, "Mmm, my
I'm feeling real red hot"

Take it easy, baby
Your temperature running hot
You going to stagger after me, wondering
A-baby, what you got

You my ball
You my rubber ball
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Oh, yeah

I picked up the telephone
And called her pa at home
He said, "Hey, little boy
You better let my daughter alone"

He says, "Oh, yeah"
I says, "Um-hmm"
He says, "You know, yeah"

Her mother got mad
And started to jump and shout
They started to run down there
And have the cops to carry me out

I says, "Oh, yeah"
She says, "Um-hmm"
I says, "Oh, yeah"
Her pop says, "Sho 'nuff"

I says, "But I love her"
I love her
I love her
I love her
