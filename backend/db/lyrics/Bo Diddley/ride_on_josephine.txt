Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
A-baby, baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Well, Josephine drivin' a hot rod Ford
Twin carburator will eat up the road
Twin exhaust stickin' out the rear
Somethin' that will really take away from here

Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
Baby, baby, ride on a-Josephine, baby ride on

Josephine's Ford begin to run hot
She tried to trade it in at a used car lot
The man couldn't believe his nat'ral eyes
When she pulled it in to his drive

Ride on, Josephine, ride on
Say, Josephine
(Ride on Josephine, ride on)
Josephine, child yo' tank is leakin' gas
(Ride on Josephine, ride on)

Say what?
Baby, you better shut up and come on ride wit' me
Ye-ah, you better ride with me

You say I better mind my business?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You got business baby, you, you good business
I just lo-ooh-ooh-ve good business! (it's sho' good)
(Oh, yeah)
You say, what kind of car I drivin'? (maroon '40 Ford)
Well, I-I'ma

I'm drivin' a '48 Cadillac
With Thunderbird wings
Tellin' you baby, that's a runnin' thing
I got wings that'll open
And get her in the air
I think I can take it away from here

A-ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on, Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine
Child, you got a runnin' machine
A-baby, baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Well, I bl-bl-believe you, baby
'Cause you-a, you-a, you ain't, been flagged
He-he

I'm goin'...
Goodbye...
Hee-hee...
