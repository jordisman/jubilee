Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Yeah, yeah, yeah Mona
Ooh, Mona

Tell you, Mona, what I want to do
Build a house next door to you
Can I see you sometime
We can go kissing through the blind

Hey you, come on on the front
Listen to my heart go bumpity bump
I need you, baby, that's no lie
Without your love I will surely die

Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Hey, hey, hey Mona
Yeah, Mona

Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Can you come out on the front
Listen to my heart go bumpity bump
I need you, baby, that's no lie
Without your love I will surely die
