A-no more a-lovin'
(Ooh, lovin')
A-no more a-huggin'
(Ooh, a-huggin')
There will be no more lovin', baby
After you've gone
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)

A-no more a-cryin'
(Ooh, a-cryin')
A-no more a-sighin'
(Ooh, a-sighin')
There will be no more cryin', baby
After you've gone
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)

I lay awake at night
Pictures of you I fight
Gone like this
You've gone
I used to dream of you
And of the love we shared

And now my dreams
Have turned into nightmares

A-no more a-kissin'
(Ooh, kissing')
What I've been a-missing
(Ooh, a-missin'}
There will be no more kissin', baby
After you've gone
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
(After you've gone)
