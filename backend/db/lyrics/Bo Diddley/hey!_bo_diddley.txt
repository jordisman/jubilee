Bo Diddley had a farm (Hey! Bo Diddley)
On that farm he had some women (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Women here, women there (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Women, women, women everywhere (Hey! Bo Diddley)

But one little girl lived on a hill (Hey! Bo Diddley)
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill (Hey! Bo Diddley)
One day she decided she'd go for a ride (Hey! Bo Diddley)
With a pistol on her shoulder and a knife by her side (Hey! Bo Diddley)

She rode right up to my front door (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Knocked and knocked till her fist got sore (Hey! Bo Diddley)
When she turned and walked away (Hey! Bo Diddley)
All you could hear my baby say (Hey! Bo Diddley)

Hey! Bo Diddley (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Hey! Bo Diddley (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Oh! Bo Diddley (Oh! Bo Diddley)
Oh! Bo Diddley (Oh! Bo Diddley)

Saw my baby run across the field (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Slippin' and sliddin' like an automobile (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Hollered at my baby and told her to wait (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Slipped off from me like a Cadillac-8 (Hey! Bo Diddley)

Hey! Bo Diddley (Hey! Bo Diddley)
Hey! Bo Diddley (Oh! Bo Diddley)
Hey! Bo Diddley (Hey! Bo Diddley)
