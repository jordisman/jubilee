Somewhere
Over the rainbow
I'll find my darling
Somewhere there I know

Darling
Do you still love me?
For I love you and I'll
I wanna always be

This love deeper
How I feel
I'll go on loving you
You still

You know that I love you
My love is true
You know can't nobody else
Take me away from you

But somewhere
Over the rainbow
I'll find my love
Somewhere there, I know

Somewhere
Over the rainbow
I'll find my love
Whoa, over there
Over there
