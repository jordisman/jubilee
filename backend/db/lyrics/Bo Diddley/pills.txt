While I was laying in a hospital bed
A rock n' roll nurse went through my head
She says, 'Hold out your arm, stick out yo' tongue
I got some pills, boy, I'm 'on give you one'

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went to my head, through my head
While I was layin' in a hospital bed

She gave me thrills from my toes
For leggin' ache
She gave me pills from her love
But a little too late

She gave me pills for my heart
To put me at ease
The rock n' roll nurse
Shook me dead to my knees

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went through my head, through my head
While I was layin' in the hospital bed

Nurses, nurses, can't you see
I don't dig this jive you givin' me?
Give me yo' pill or give me your shot
You got me wonderin' what, what have I got?

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
Through my head, she went through my head
While I was layin' in that hospital bed

Doctor, doctor, run here 'n see
I don't dig this jive this nurse givin' me
She gimme a shot, she give me yo' pills
I'm takin' this junk a'gin my will

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, to my head
He went through my head, through my head
While I was layin' in that hospital bed

Ow! Look out man, Ow!
