Little girl, I go home with you
Little girl, I go home with you
You know, pretty baby
Crazy about the things you do

Tell me, baby, tell me your name
You know pretty mama
You're beautiful thing
Little girl, can I go home with you?

I like the way, the way you walk
Crazy 'bout the things, baby, you talk
Little girl, let me go home with you

Tell your mama, your papa, too
How much I love with you
Little girl, let me go home with you

I asked, baby, 'bout twenty-one
You know pretty mama
We could have a lot of fun
Little girl, later, I go home with you

You asked, baby, 'bout twenty-two
I'd just like to make love to you
Well, little girl, can I go home with you?
