You gonna be sorry that you left me alone
(You're going to be sorry)
Packed your bags and now you gone
(You're going to be sorry)
Tried everything to get along with you
(You're going to be sorry)
I tried every little thing I knew how to do
(You're going to be sorry)
You don't love me, don't love me no more
Was that the reason why you wanna go back home?
Go back home

Told you baby that I will roam
(You're going to be sorry)
But all you could say was you want to go home
(You're going to be sorry)
You know, baby, that I love you so
(You're going to be sorry)
Ain't no way that I can let you go
(You're going to be sorry)
You don't love me, that I know
A-that's the reason why you wanna go back home
Yeah
Go back home

Took you downtown just the other day
(You're going to be sorry)
People begin to crowd around and say
(You're going to be sorry)
You don't love me, love me no more
(You're going to be sorry)
That the reason why you wanna go
(You're going to be sorry)
You don't love me, love me no more
But that's the reason why you wanna go back home
Back home
