I've been wrong before
But I know for sure
That I saw you last night
Out
With another guy
It nearly made me cry
So I'm telling you girl
Stand by me my love
And I'll give you anything you want
Anytime you want

So, stand by me my love
And I'll give you everything
And I'll give you everything
Stand by me my love
And I'll give you anything you want
Anytime you want

So, stand by me my love
And I'll give you everything
And I'll give you everything
I, I've been wrong before
But I know for sure
That I saw you last night
Out
With another guy
It nearly made me cry

So I'm telling you girl
Cry
So I'm telling you girl
Cry
So I'm telling you girl
Cry
