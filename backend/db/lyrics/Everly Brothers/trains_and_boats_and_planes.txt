Trains and boats and planes
Are passing by
They mean a trip
To Paris or Rome
For someone else
But not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away
Away from me

We were so in love
And high above
We had a star
To wish upon, wish
And dreams came true
But not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away
Away from me

Trains and boats and planes
Took you away
But every time
I see them I pray
And if my prayer
Can cross the sea
The trains and boats and planes
Will bring you back
Back home to me...
Mmm
Mmm
Trains and boats and planes
