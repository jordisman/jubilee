My room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
It's awful dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "I do"
Well, I feel so sad and blue
It's all because of you
I could cry, cry, cry
I could die, die, die
I live on a, lonely avenue
A lonely avenue

My covers they feel like leather
My pillow it feels like stone
I've tossed and turned so every night,
I'm not used to sleeping alone
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "I do"
I feel so sad and blue
It's all because of you.
I could cry, cry, cry
I could die, die, die
I live on a, lonely avenue
A lonely avenue

I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you've left this town
If I knew where you had gone child,
Well I'd be highway bound
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, "I do"
Well, I feel so sad and blue
It's all because of you.
I could cry, cry, cry
I could die, die, die
I live on a, lonely avenue, a lonely avenue
