Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowin god of Mars
Body burning bright

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind

Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind

Ridin' on the wind! Ridin' on the wind!
Ridin' on the wind! RIDING ON THE WIND!

Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
