It's very far away
It takes about half a day to get there
If we travel by my dragonfly
No it's not in Spain
But all the same, you know, it's a groovy name
And the wind's just right, hey

Hang on my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of a Spanish castle magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow with cotton candy
And battlegrounds, red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time on bad things
Just float your little mind around, look out

Hang on my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish castle magic, yeah baby, here's some

Yeah, okay babe, okay
It's still all in your mind babe

Hang on my darling, hey
Hang on, hang on if you wanna go
And it's happening, oh no, damn hey
That's right baby, listen, a little bit of Spanish castle magic, hey
Little bit of Spanish castle magic, hey hey
I can't uh, sing this song, no
Yeah, okay baby, get on baby, yeah
It's all in your mind baby
Little bit of daydream here and there

Yeah
Ooh yeah
Ow
Everything's gonna be alright
