Here I come to save the day

A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said "Get out there, man, and do your best" ooh

They call him Astro Man
And he's flyin' higher than
That faggot Superman ever could

Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut
And he's twice as dense as Donald Duck
And he'll try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind
Oh, regard my baby, come on!

Astro Man, flyin' across the sky two times higher
Than that old faggot Superman ever, ever could
Ever could, yeah
Ha

There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops, no one knows
There he goes, there he goes, ya
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind
Astro Man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him, yeah
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind
Astro Man will blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
Hoo-hoo, ye-ye-ye-yeah, blow out the rest, blow out the rest of
Your mind
