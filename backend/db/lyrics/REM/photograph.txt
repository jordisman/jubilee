I found this photograph
Underneath broken picture glass
Tender face of black and white
Beautiful, a haunting sight
Looked into an angel's smile
Captivated all the while
From her hair and clothes she wore
I'd have placed her in between the wars
Was she willing when she sat
And posed a pretty photograph
To save her flowering and fair
For days to come
For days to share

A big smile for the camera
How did she know
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

I found this photograph
In stacks between the old joist walls
In a place where time is lost
Lost behind where all things fall
Broken books and calendars
Letters script in careful hand
The music to a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band
From the thresh hold what's to see
Of our brave new century
Television's just a dream
Of radio and silver screen

A big smile for the camera
How did she know
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

Was her childhood filled with rhyme
Or stolen books of passion crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day?
Was she hopeful? Did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside
Family secrets sworn to hide?
Did she feel the heat that stirs
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend
In love and laughter until the end?
