You wanted a challenge that's calling you higher
I landed on my feet by crawling
I remember standing alone trying to forget you idling
I hate to admit that that's my reference point
But there it is you say you want me

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air, you're in the air and I am breathing

Brighten the stars
The weather is lifting the heavens love a love like this
It's pulling you higher twist it and turn this around
It lights from within it dribbles your chin
Now brings a smile, I'm lost again
I'm lost again

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air, you're in the air and I am breathing you

I want the stars to know they've won if only to beguile
The sky has opened up again in heavens reconciled
I want you naked, I want you wild, I want the stars to know they win
Give me that smile, just give it me, just turn it on, I'm lost again

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're everywhere, you're in the air and I am breathing you
