Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongue, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards
Down her back

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongue, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards
Down her back

Give me a couple, don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation
What is in my mind, what is in my mind

Now what does that mean? Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, oh, come on, hesitate, hesitate.)

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongues, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards

Turn to lies and conversation fear, conversation fear
Conversation fear, conversation fear
