Then into our life, there comes the darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard

And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten-ton head made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinities

Then into your life, there comes the darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into our darkest hour

Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me
Sweet darling
Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me?
Sweet darling
Sweet time
Sweet dark
Sweet dark
