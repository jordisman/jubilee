[3x:]
A moon-shaped pool, dancing clothes,
You love and now I know, but hold me, hold me.

Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all...

Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all...

And now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

And now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can...

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can create

But when I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know.

But when I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know.
