Grandma loved a sailor, who sailed the frozen sea 
Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee 
He said, "Son, I'm going crazy from livin' on the land 
Got to find my shipmates and walk in foreign sands." 

This old man was graceful with silver in his smile 
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked four country miles 
Singing songs of shady sisters in old town Liberty 
Songs of love and songs of death and songs to set men free 
Ya! 

I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread 
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow till half of us are dead 
Land ho! 

Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill 
If I get my hands on a number five gonna skin that little girl alive 
If I get my hands on a number two come back home and marry you 
Marry you, marry you 
Alright! 

Eh land ho!
Eh land ho!

Well if I get back home and I feel alright
You know babe I'm gonna love you right, love you right, love you right

Eh land ho!
Eh land ho!
Eh!
