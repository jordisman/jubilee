If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all

But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
That I'll stand by you if ever you should call

And if I should ever hear
That he made you she'd a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried

If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Yes, I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
