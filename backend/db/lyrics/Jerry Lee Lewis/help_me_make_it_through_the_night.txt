Take the ribbon from your hair shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft upon my skin like the shadows on the wall
Come on and lay down by my side till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time just help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
Well yesterday is dead and gone yes it is and tomorrow's out of sight
It's so sad to be alone (think about it now) help me make it through the night
