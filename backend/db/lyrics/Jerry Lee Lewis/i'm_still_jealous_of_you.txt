I'm so afraid that somebody else
Is gonna find his way into your heart
There's always a chance a stranger might find
Some way to pull us apart
Darlin' you give me no reason to worry my mind
'Cause you've never once been untrue
It's just that I've loved you for such a long time
I'm still jealous of you

You're a good lookin' woman who could tempt any man
And that's why I feel like I do 
Sometimes ol' Jerry's feelings they get a little out of hand
'Cause I'm still jealous of you

I live with the fear that I'll wake up some day
And I won't be the first in your heart
You know darlin' nothin' hurts worse than the memories you save
After a love falls apart (Think about it)
So darlin' please don't blame me for keeping what's mine
And guarding our precious love like I do
It's just that I've loved you for such a long time
I'm still jealous of you
Honey I'm still jealous of you (Better believe I am baby)
