Down the street a baby just cried
When he woke up all alone
A train's leaving town oh that lonesome sound
Is chilling me right to the bone

A song is playing
I can barely hear about a love that's gone wrong
The freezing rain on my window pane
Listen they're playing my song

Taps being played by a soldier's grave
So sad it torments your soul
Listen to that old cold north wind blow
Tonight it's dark and cold

Somewhere a siren cuts through the night
It sounds like the whole world's gone wrong
Thunder just warned oh it's coming a storm
Listen they're playing my song
Listen they're playing my song
