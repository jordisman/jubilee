Well they shot him in the back seat of a Lincoln limousine
Was a great, great leader by the name of Kennedy
He fought for right and freedom, tried to keep this nation clean
But they shot him in the backseat of a Lincoln limousine

And he had ten million dollars, had the world right in his hand
But a twenty dollar rifle cut the life of this great man
He had a lovely wife and two children seldom seen
But they shot him in the backseat of a Lincoln limousine

Well they shot him out in Texas where the longhorn cattle roam
Oh Lord it would have been better if he had stayed at home
This nation is a great place but one fact still remains
That they shot a president in the backseat of a limousine

Well they shot him in the back seat of a Lincoln limousine
Was a great, great leader by the name of Kennedy
He fought for right and freedom tried to keep this nation clean
But they shot him in the backseat of a Lincoln limousine

And this man he did not die on a far and distant shore
He died at Dallas Texas a place not known for war
This country is supposed to be the land of the brave and free
But they shot him in the backseat of a Lincoln limousine

And the moral of the story that it really has no end
It goes to show you never know who's your enemy or your friend

Well they shot him in the back seat of a Lincoln limousine
Was a great, great leader by the name of Kennedy
He fought for right and freedom tried to keep this nation clean
But they shot him in the backseat of that Lincoln limousine
