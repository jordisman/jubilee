Softly close that old door behind you
Honey how it hurts to see you go
Gently break the tie that binds you
This ol' heart my God woman it loved you so

If you're sure honey you won't be staying
Then just walk on out of my life
You know there's just two words that's left for saying
And the Lord knows how I hate goodbyes

Nothing's born (nothing's born)
To live forever (to live forever)
But oh how it hurts to see it die
First it's always then it's never
And the Lord knows how I hate goodbyes

Nothing's born (nothing's born)
To live forever (to live forever)
But oh how it hurts to see it die
First it's always then it's never
And the Lord knows how I hate goodbyes
