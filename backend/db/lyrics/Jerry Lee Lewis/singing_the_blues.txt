Well I never felt more like
Singing the blues
'Cause I never thought that
I'd ever lose
Your loving
Why'd you do me this way

Well I never felt more
Like cryin' all night
'Cause everything's wrong
And nothing ain't right
Without you

Got me singing the blues
The moon and the stars
No longer shine
The dream is gone
I thought it was mine
There's nothin' left
For me to do
But cry over you

Well I never felt more
Like runnin' away
Why should I go when I
Couldn't stay
Without you
Got me singing the blues
The moon and the stars

No longer shine
The dream is gone
I thought it was mine
There's nothin' left
Or me to do

But cry over
Well I never felt more
Like runnin' away
Why should I go when
I couldn't stay
Without you
Got me singing the blues
Got me singing the blues
Got me singing the blues
