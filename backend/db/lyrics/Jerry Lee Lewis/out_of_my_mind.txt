I'm sitting here drinking thinking of you
Wondering where you are and the love we once knew
This old town ain't much for a man all alone
But it's better than nothing when I want to get stoned

Out of my mind
When I leave this old bar I don't know where I'm going
Because of the bottle there's no way of knowing
That I'm out of my mind

It all goes back to the good times we had
The glad times and sad times oh they were both good and bad
But honey if you'll ever need me well I'll be around
Yeah right on that old corner in that same old bar downtown

Out of my mind
When I leave this old bar I don't know where I'm going
Because of the bottle there's no way of knowing
That I'm out of my mind
