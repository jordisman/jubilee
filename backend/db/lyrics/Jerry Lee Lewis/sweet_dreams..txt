Sweet, sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't, why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Oh you, you don't love me, it's plain
I should have known I'll never share your name
Yes I, I should hate you the whole night through
But I keep having sweet dreams about you

Oh I know, I know I should hate you,
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
