You sat your sight on someone,
Who belonged to someone else,
Just to see if you could have the one you pleased

You weren't complete, until you got me,
I lost her, and then you dropped me,
You went out of your way to walk on me

You went out of your way to walk on me
You were reachin' for a soul that was not free, Yeah
With so many hearts for the takin', you chose mine for the breakin'
You went out of your way to walk on me

Yeah, you went out of your way to walk on me,
You were reachin' for a soul that was not free,
With so many hearts for the takin', you chose mine for the breakin'
You went out of your way to walk on me
Oh baby, you went out of your way to walk on me,
Walk on baby!
