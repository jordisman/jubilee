If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue,
You'd have a room full of roses.
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night,
You'd have a room full of roses;

And if you took the petals and tore them all apart,
You'd be tearin' at the roses just the way you tore my heart!

If someday you're feelin' blue,
You could send some roses too!
Well, I don't want a room full o' roses,
I just want my arms full o' you!

You'd have a room full of roses.

You'd have a room full of roses.

And if you took the petals and tore them all apart,
You'd be tearin' at the roses just the way you tore my heart!

If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue,
You'd have a room full of roses.
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night,
You'd have a room full of roses;

And if you took the petals and tore them all apart,
You'd be tearin' at the roses just the way you tore my heart!

If someday you're feelin' blue,
And you could send some roses too,
Well, I don't want a room full o' roses,
I just want my arms full of you!
