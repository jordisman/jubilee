For months she's a perfect wife and a mother
You'd never dream that things could go so wrong
But like a cloud across the skies
I see the sadness fill her eyes
Then one day I'll come in and she'll be gone

When baby gets the blues my world turns over
While she's out somewhere with her bright lights and her booze
Until the day she comes back home ashamed and sober
My world stops turning when baby gets the blues

As long as she has me I know I'll keep forgiving
Though I'm afraid of how much I'll someday lose
I just can't tell you what a happy world that I live in
In between the times that my baby gets them ol' blues

When baby gets the blues my world turns over
While she's out somewhere with her bright lights and her booze
Until the day she comes back home ashamed and sober
My world turns over when baby gets the blues
My world turns over when baby gets the blues
