Your cheating heart will make you weep 
You'll cry and cry you'll try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through 
Your cheating heart will tell on you

When tears come down like falling rain 
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do 
Your cheating heart is gonna tell on you

Yes when tears come down like falling rain 
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do 
Your cheating heart is gonna tell on you
