Well I'm makin' alright from Monday morning to Friday night
Oh those lonely weekends
Since you left me I'm as lonely as I can be oh those lonely weekends
Said you'd be (said you'd be) so good to Jerry Lee (good to me)
You said our love (said our love) would never die (never die)
You said you'd be (said you'd be) so good to me (good to me)
But baby you didn't even try
Well I'm makin' alright (well I'm makin' alright) from Monday morning to Friday night
But oh those lonely weekends yeah

You said you'd be (said you should be)...
I said oh those lonely weekends I said oh those lonely weekends
