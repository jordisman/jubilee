She lies there so peaceful in her eternal sleep
With wreaths of flowers from her head to her feet
A gown of gold she wears to match her silver hair

A peaceful smile upon her face
That shows her heavenly grace
Come gather 'round children bow your head and pray
Come gather 'round children while they lay Mama away

She gave us all her good years oh Lord she gave us all her best
Come gather 'round children while they lay our precious Mama to rest
Now Dad he's waited so long for Mama to join him
And on her right lies my brother John

On Dad's left lies my sister a flower taken Lord while still in bloom
I know we'll miss her but Lord they'll be so glad to see her
