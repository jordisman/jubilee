Now when I get the blues I get me a rockin' chair
When I get the blues I get me a rockin' chair
Well the blues don't get me gonna rock on away from here
Give me one more kiss hold it a long long time
Now love me baby till a feelin' hits my head like wine
Oh flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
Now flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't you ever say goodbye

Oh when I get lonesome I jump on the telephone
When I get lonesome I jump on the telephone
I call my baby tell her I'm gonna come back home
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I got so many women Lord I don't know which way to jump
Jump jump let's go now
Flip flop and fly I don't care if I die...
