(Today I can feel it touching home)
Today pain became a real life's hurtin' thing
And the choir of loneliness sang me a song
Now I know just what it means to lose a lifetime dream
Cause today I can feel it touching home
No longer do I wonder why men have lost their minds
Or wind up in a jungle of flashing neon signs
Now I know just how long a man can last when love is gone
Cause today I can feel it touching home

No longer do I wonder why men have lost their minds
Or wind up in a jungle of flashing neon signs
Now I know just how long a man can last when love is gone
Cause today I can feel it touching home
Cause today I can feel it touching home
