Wailin' on the corner like an ol' tomcat shoutin' and a shakin' almost off my bat
Who walks by me oh my jumpin' jeshosaphat big blon' baby
Yesterday she kissed me she was so divine
Fell right down and begged her to be mine all mine
Held her tight ooh good night jumpin' jeshosaphat big blon' baby
Big blon' baby ooh glory to be here I go again big blon' baby
Yeah Lord I love you so I love her love her so
I shiver and I quiver when she kisses me Lord she gonna set ol' Jerry Lee free
Held her tight ooh good night jumpin' jeshosaphat big blon' baby

Big blon' baby ooh glory to be here I go again big blon' baby
Yeah Lord I love you so I love her love her so
I shiver and I quiver when she kisses me Lord she gonna set ol' Jerry Lee free
Held her tight ooh good night jumpin' jeshosaphat big blon' baby

Big Blon' Baby I love you honey squeeze you with all my might yeah up tight
Whoa fade out gotta do grrr hang it in give it to me let it all hang out
