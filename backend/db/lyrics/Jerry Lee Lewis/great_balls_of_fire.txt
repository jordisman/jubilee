You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

I laughed at love when I thought it was funny
But you came along and you moved me honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Kiss me baby, woo, it feels good
Hold me baby, ooh, yeah, you gonna love me like a lover should
You're fine, so kind, I'm gonna tell this world that you're mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

I chew my nails, I twiddle my thumbs
I'm really nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Ohhh, kiss me baby, woo-oooooo, feels good, yeah
Let me love you like a lover should.
You're fine. So kind.
I gonna tell this world that you're mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
