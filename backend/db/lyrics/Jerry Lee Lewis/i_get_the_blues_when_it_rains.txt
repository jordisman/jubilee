It was raining, dear, when I met you
You smiled, the sun shone through
Then it rained again and I lost you
Just why I never knew.
Now every time the storm clouds gather way up in the sky,
I see them all and I recall those happy days gone by:

I get the blues when it rains,
The blues I can't lose when it rains
Each little drop that falls on my window pane
Always reminds me of the tears I've shed in vain
I sit and wait for the sun
To shine down on me once again
It rained when I found you, It rained when I lost you,
That's why I'm so blue when it rains.
