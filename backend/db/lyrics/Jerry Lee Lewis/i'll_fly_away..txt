Well, some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away

To a home where joy shall never end
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
