My love for you will always be just a faded memory
Guess I'll cry and cry for you yes no matter what you do
You gave me love when there was none you know you're the only one
Yes I'll cry and cry in vain I want my baby back again
Mathilda I'll cry and cry for you Lord no matter what you do
Yes I'll cry and cry in vain I want my baby back again

Oh Mathilda I'll cry and cry for you...
