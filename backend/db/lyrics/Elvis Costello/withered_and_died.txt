This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died

Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind thoughts in my head, kind voices to hear

Then I took up with a girl from the West
They'd run and hide, they'd run and hide
Count one to ten and she's gone like the rest
My dreams have withered and died

If I was a butterfly, lived for a day
I could be free just blowing away

Silver moon sail up and silver moon shine
On the waters so wide, waters so wide
Slip from the bed of a good friend of mine
My dreams have withered and died

Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind thoughts in my head, kind voices to hear

This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died
My dreams have withered and died
My dreams have withered and died
