Oh... Rosalinda
Why do you cry?
Oh... Rosalinda
Could this be why?
Now that there's nothing left to do
Now that the children have all grown
Now all you have is just a cat and a silent telephone

Oh... Rosalinda
Why do you weep?
Oh... Rosalinda
Alone you sleep
But the neighbors turn away
What will it take for them to learn
That all you want to do is love and
To be loved in return?

Oh... Rosalinda
We've gone away
Oh... Rosalinda
Still you stay
Being what you've always been
And doing what you've always done
How can we give you back the time
You gave to us when you were young?

Oh... Rosalinda
Turn out the light
Oh... Rosalinda
Rosalinda. Say goodnight
Now that the children have all grown
Now that we've all gone away
Now that you're sitting at your home
Without a word to say
