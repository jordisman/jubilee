Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore

When I was a little younger
I had to justify my angst
I'd spend a lotta precious time
Tryna find the facts
Then one day, I met Mikael
Mikael don't like my whine
So now I don't look toward my death
I look toward my life

Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore

When me and my girl walk down the street
I don't stare people out
All the things I used to do like that
I do without
Everything with her makes sense
Everything is real
You don't need no evidence
When you're sayin' what you feel

Nothing, yeah
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore

Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
