You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me
And I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world
With silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
Cos here I go again

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

Ah, I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me
Now can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more
She gave it all to me
Now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know
Cos here I go again

I love you, I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly
Love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

Ah, I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?

Ah, he gave me more
He gave it all to me
Say, can't you see? 

Ah, I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?

Ah, he gave me more
He gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?

Ah, I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?

Ah, he gave me more
He gave it all to me
Say, can't you see? 

You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no,
Some people want to fill the world
With silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
