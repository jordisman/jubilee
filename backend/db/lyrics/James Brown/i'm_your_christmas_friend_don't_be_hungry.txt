The story of Christmas is as old as time itself
So believe me, brothers and sisters
Let's not put none of that good soul talent on the shelf
Have you been worried and lonely, and didn't know what to do?
Come and take a few of these simple lessons from James Brown, me
And you'll feel the same way, too

Ha, I do the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, whenever I'm blue
Don't worry 'bout nothin', get some exercise
And you can do the same thing, too
You know the story, on Christmas morn'
A sweet little baby boy was born
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend
I'm your friend

Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your friend
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm, I'm your Christmas friend
Don't be hungry 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your Christmas friend
Hey, listen to me, don't be hungry
When I'm in need, I dig talent to make my heart bleed
It makes my heart bleed with blood as red as wine
To dance is what makes me say I don't wanna cry

I've got the feeling, I'm soaking wet
Get up! I'm in a cold sweat
Alright now, alright now, I'm in a cold sweat
I do the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, whenever I'm blue
Don't worry 'bout nothin', get some exercise
You can do the same thing, too
You know the story, on Christmas morn'
A sweet little baby boy was born
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your friend
I'm your friend, I'm your friend, I'm your friend

Don't be hungry, when I'm in need, I dig talent
It makes my heart bleed
It makes my heart bleed with blood and fire
To dance is what makes me say, I don't wanna cry
I got the feeling, I'm soaking wet
Get up! I'm in a cold, cold...
