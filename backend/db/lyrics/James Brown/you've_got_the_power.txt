I need you darlin'
You've got the power to love
Mmmmm, you've got the power in your hand
You've got the power to make me
Understand
But oh, I want you to try me
You've got the power to love
Oh darlin'

I told you darlin'
That I'll stand by your side
Remember the day
You made me cry
Oh darlin', oh my little darlin'
You've got the power to love

We belong together
And darlin' you know
I don't have to look no further
'Cause

You've got the power
(Yes you have)
In your hand
(Yes you have)
You've got the power
(You've got the power)
To make me understand
(You've got the power)
You've all I need
(You've got the power)
You're all I want baby
(You've got the power)
You're all I want baby
(You've got the power)
I say it one more time
(You've got the power)
Just wanna hear you say it
(You've got the power)
Make me feel so good now
(You've got the power darlin')
Make me feel so nice
(And I need you)
Make me feel
(I need you)
Let me hear you scream one time
(I need you)
A little bit louder baby
(I need you)
Let me hear you hold it one time
(I need you)
A little bit louder...
