Won't even write, won't even call
You won't let me nothing at all
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

You made me love you right from the start
And my baby you was gonna break my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

Oh baby you made me love you
And you keep my heart in pain
Oh baby there's no-one above you
And I wonder will we ever, ever love again

I know I loved you right from the start
And that's why you, you broke my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

Oh baby you made me love you
And you keep my heart in pain
Oh baby there's no-one above you
And I wonder will we ever, ever love again

You made me love you right from the start
And my baby you was gonna break my heart
I know why you, you broke my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you
No-one but you
