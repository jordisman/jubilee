Woke up this morning baby was gone 
Just so bad I was all alone 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 

She, she said she loved me 
What a way to take me 
Told her I wouldn't, I wouldn't understand 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 

(When I) I lost everything I had 
Baby went I lost you 
And you, you made me (you made me) feel so bad 
You just won't be true 

Baby you are on my mind 
You're leaving me 
I don't feel so vague in mind 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 
You know 

(When I) I lost everything I had 
Baby went I lost you 
And you, you made me (you made me) feel so bad 
You just won't be true 

Baby you are on my mind 
You're leaving me 
I don't feel so vague in mind 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 
You know 

That's when I lost my heart
