Sometimes I get a little lonely 
And sometimes I get a little blue

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
Sometimes I get a little, a little, a little lonely 

And sometimes, sometimes I get a little blue
The greatest thing is just to love and be loved in return
