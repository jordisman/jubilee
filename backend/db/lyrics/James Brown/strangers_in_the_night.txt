Strangers in the night, exchanging glances
Wondering in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night to a lonely people world
Strangers in the night up to the moment
When we said our first hello, how little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embrace's a dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight in love forever
It turned out so right for we were strangers in the night

Strangers in the night to lonely people world
Strangers in the night up to the moment
When we said our first hello, how little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embrace's a dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight in love forever
It turned out so right for we were strangers in the night
We were strangers in the night

Didn't even know my name
Don't even, don't even know my name
I gotta have you just the same
I gotta have you, I gotta have you just the same
