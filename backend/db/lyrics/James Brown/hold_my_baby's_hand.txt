I don't mind, there's a way on ferry 
I don't mind, this load my baby make me carry 
I don't mind, everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand 

I don't mind, it's the way you fool me 
I don't mind, take all life to scoon me 
I don't mind, everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand 

Did you ever feel so low 
Did you ever feel so low 
Did you ever feel so bad 
And you mised all the fun 
That you thought you had 
When you feel so bad 
And you missed all the fun 
That you thought you bad 
Everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand
