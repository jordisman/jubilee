Well don't leave my baby no, no, no, no 
Don't leave my baby no, no, no, no 
Don't leave my baby no. no, no, no 
Don't go, don't go, don't go 

Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't lie, fool with my baby 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no 

I've been shook, I've been loved 
I've been laid in my grave 
Told my friends my best pals 
Don't ever let you catch with my gal
