My babe don't stand no cheatin', my babe
My babe, true little baby, my babe
My babe don't stand no cheatin'
She don't stand none of that midnight creepin'
My babe, true little baby, my babe

My babe, she loves me steady, my babe
My babe, a groovin' little babe, my babe
My baby loves me steady
My babe, she always ready
My babe, a groovin' little babe, my babe

My baby don't stand no cheatin', my babe
Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin', my babe
Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin'
Ev'rything she do she do so pleasin'
My babe, true little baby, my babe

My babe don't [?] me no foolin', my babe
My babe, she don't stand no foolin', my babe
Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin'
When she's hot, she tells me to cool her
My babe, [?] my babe
