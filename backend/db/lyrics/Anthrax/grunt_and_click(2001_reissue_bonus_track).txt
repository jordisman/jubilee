It's not that I hate people
I just feel better when they're not around
It's not that I hate your world
Keep pushing me and I'll stand my ground
It's not that I hate you
You'd have to kill me to take me down

Push me again
Push me again

Find satisfaction on the island where I live
Cause zombies only take, they don't have any life to give
It's never been, will never be a picnic
So step right up and pull your fucking reign again
Slackety-slack, lack of inspiration
Be the voice of a new generation

This is me
Past the point of caring
This is me
Push me but I won't go
Down down down down down

I don't need a license
I know the drill

I hope you have a happy
A happy fuckin' day
La-la-la amuse yourself
I won't get in the way

I just can't stand your apathetic motion
As if you care showing your devotion
Kicking and screaming, thinking that I meant it
If I was dead I couldn't be more over it

Over and over and you wouldn't talk about it
Over and over but you try to keep it down

This is me
Past the point of caring
This is me
Push me but I won't go
Down down down down down

I don't need a license
I know the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will

Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it

Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will

Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will

Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will

Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will

Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it

I don't need a license
I know the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will

I don't need a license
I am the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will

Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it
