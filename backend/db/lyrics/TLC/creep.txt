Yes it's me again
And I'm back

Creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Creep
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Creep

The 22nd of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me

I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies
To keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep yeah
I just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
So I creep

The 23rd of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same

I'll keep giving loving
'Til the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected

So I creep yeah
I just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
So I creep

I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah can you dig it
Love you forever baby soul and mind
And you gotta know if you don't give it
I'mma get mine

Oh I oh I oh I
So I creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
So I creep
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection

I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection

So I creep yeah
Just keep it on the down low
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do

So I creep yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
