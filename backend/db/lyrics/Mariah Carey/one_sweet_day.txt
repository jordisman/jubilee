Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together, together
One sweet day
And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darling, I never showed you
I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
I know we'll be together
One sweet day
And all that I know is I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
Yes, I know
One sweet day
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
I'll see you eventually
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
I know you're looking down from heaven
And I know eventually we'll be together
I know, I know
Yes, we will
One sweet day
One sweet day
Patiently to see you in heaven

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
