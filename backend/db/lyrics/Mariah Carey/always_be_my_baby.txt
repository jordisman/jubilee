Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,

We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back, boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back, baby
Oh, baby, believe me it's only a matter of time, time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on, and we will linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me, ooh, baby
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
You and I will always be!
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
You and I 
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

You and I will always be
No way you'll never gonna shake me
No way you'll never gonna shake me
You and I will always be
