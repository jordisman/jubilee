I'm writing a song all about you a true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it cause no one will hear it
Cause sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated I'd like to the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even with you cause you're leavin'
And songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star you don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it no one will play it
Cause sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
[steel]
Well it's a good thing...
