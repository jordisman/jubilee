You tell me today that you're leaving 
But just think a while 
I'm sure that you must know 
Today might be the day that you walk away 
But you left me a long, long time ago 

Today's just the day that ends it all 
Except the usual mem'ries 
That always linger on 
And today might be the day that you walk away 
But you left me a long, long time ago 

I stood with helpless hands 
And watched me lose your love 
A little more each day 
Then it was gone 
And I kept wond'rin' 
Just how long until this day would come 
Just how long could your pride keep hangin' on 

So please don't say you're sorry 
Don't say anything 
Don't try to say why you must leave 
Just go 
And today might be the day that you walk away 
But you left me a long, long time ago
