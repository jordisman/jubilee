Touch me, touch the hand of a man 
Who once owned all the world 
And touch, me touch the arms 
That once held all the charms 
Of the world's sweetest girl 
Touch me, maybe someday you may 
Need to know how it feels when you lose 
And so touch me, you'll know 
How you feel with the blues 

Watch me, watch the eyes 
That have seen all the heartache 
And pain in the land 
And be thankful you're happy though 
Standing so close to the world's bluest man 
Don't forget me, take a good look 
At someone who's lost everything he can lose 
And then touch me and you'll know 
How you'd feel with the blues 

[guitar]

Don't forget me take a good look...
