I lose my blues honey when I'm with you
No one else can do you're in my heart to stay
But when I'm gone and I'm all alone
I'll be singing a song I want to be with you always

[piano]

I'd be happy dear if you could only be here and always be near forever and a day
We could travel far to some big shining star
Just me and my guitar and stay that sweethears for always
I lose my blues...
