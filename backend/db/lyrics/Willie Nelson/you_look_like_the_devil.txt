You look like the devil in the morning you've been out a working through the night
Holdin' hands and kissin' everybody I'm glad to say that you can't blow my mind

You look like the devil when you're cryin' I'm so glad that you feel so strong that way
You got a great big smile for everybody I'm so glad I've met you yesterday
[steel]
You look like the devil in the morning...
[guitar]
You look like the devil when you're cryin'...
I'm so glad I've met you yesterday
