(I'll always love you in my own peculiar way) 
It would be a comfort just to know you never doubt me 
Even though I give you cause most every day 
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me 
Although I love you in my own peculiar way 
Don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wonder 
To a suddenly remembered yesterday 
Cause my mind could never stay too long away from you 
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way 
And though I may not always be the way you'd have me be 
And though my faults may grow in number day by day 
Let no one ever say that I've ever been untrue 
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way 
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
