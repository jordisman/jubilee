Who's sorry now, who's sorry now
Whose heart is achin' for breakin' each vow
Who's sad and blue, who's cryin' too
Just like I cried over you.

Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now.

Right to the end just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now.
