My world is like a river as dark as it is deep 
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep 
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me 
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories 
Sweet memories sweet memories hmm 

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night 
Wondering from room to room turning on each light 
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea 
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories 
Sweet memories sweet memories hmm
