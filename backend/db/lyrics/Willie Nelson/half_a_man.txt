If I'd only had one arm to hold you better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you there'd be one less mem'ry to recall
If I'd only had one ear to listen to the lies that you told to me
Then I more closely resemble the half a man that you've made of me
[strings + piano]
If I'd only had one leg to stand on then how much how much truer picture you'd see
For then I more closely resemble the half a man that you've made of me
