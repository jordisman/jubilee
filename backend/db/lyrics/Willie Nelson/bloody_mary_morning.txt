It's a Bloody Mary morning, 
Baby left me without warning 
Sometime in the night 
So I'm flyin' down to Houston 
Forgetting her's the nature of my flight 

As we taxi toward the runway 
With the smog and haze 
Reminding me of how I feel 
Just a country boy who's learnin' 
That the pitfalls of the city 
Are extremely real 

All the night life and the parties 
And temptation and deceit 
The order of the day 
Well it's a Bloody Mary mornin' 
Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in LA 
It's a Bloody Mary morning... 

[guitar]

Our golden jet is airborn 
And flight Fifty cuts a path 
Across the mornin' sky 
And a voice comes on the speaker 
Reassuring us flight Fifty 
Is the way to fly 

And a hostess takes our order 
Coffee tea or something stronger 
To start off the day 
Well it's a Bloody Mary morning 
Cause I'm leavin' baby somewhere in LA 
It's a bloody mary morning...
