I come home last Saturday morning I come home and found you gone
Well there was a note tacked on my door said your baby don't love you anymore
Well I got dressed up and I went downtown I got dressed up and I went downtown
Well I walked up and I walked down
Well there weren't no love there weren't no love around

There weren't no love around there weren't no love around
There weren't no love around there weren't no love around
There weren't no love around there weren't no love around
There weren't no love around there weren't no love around

Well I come home and I lay down I felt my head spinning round and round
Lord I poured my dreams and I drank 'em down no there weren't no love
There weren't no love around
There weren't no love around....
