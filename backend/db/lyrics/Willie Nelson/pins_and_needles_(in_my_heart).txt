I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I'm here without you
There's pins and needles in my heart

The days and nights are growing longer
Since first you said that we must part
And now you're smiling at another
And there's pins and needles in my heart

I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I'm here without you
There's pins and needles in my heart

I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I'm here without you
There's pins and needles in my heart

I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
