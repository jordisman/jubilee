I've been throwin' horseshoes 
Over my left shoulder 
I've spent most all my life 
Searching for that four leaf clover 
Yet you run with me 
Chasing my rainbows 
Honey, I love you too 
That's the way love goes 
That's the way love goes 
Babe, that's the music God made 
For the whole wide world to sing 
It never gets old 
It always grows 
Losing makes me sorry 
You say don't you worry 
Honey, I love you too 
And that's the way love goes 

[harmonica - piano]

That's the way love goes babe...
