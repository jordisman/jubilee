Well I can't read your mind 
When you changed all the time 
And I don't what's matter with you 
I think I do my share to show that I care 
So just tell me what do you want me to do 
I've tried to be kind but it don't work sometimes 
And you're not the same person that I knew 
And tell me where should I start to return to your heart 
And tell me what do you want me to do 
What do you want me to do with the dreams that I own 
Should I changed them to mem'ries and leave you alone 
Maybe I'm not too smart I guess you know me by heart 
And if my chances of winning are few 
Let my heart step aside with what's left of my pride 
And tell me what do you want me to do 
Tell me what do you want me to do
