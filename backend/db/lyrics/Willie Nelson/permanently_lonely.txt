Don't be concerned it's time I learned 
That those who play with fire get burned 
But I'll be alright in a little while 
But you'll be permanently lonely 
Don't be too quick to pity me 
Don't salve my heart with sympathy 
Cause I'll be alright in a little while 
But you'll be permanently lonely 
The world looks on with wonder 
And pity at your kind 
Cause it knows that the future 
Is not very pretty for your kind for your kind 
Will always be runnin' and wonderin' 
What's happened to hearts that you've broken 
And left all alone 
But we'll be alright in a little while 
But you'll be permanently lonely 
Runnin' lonely
