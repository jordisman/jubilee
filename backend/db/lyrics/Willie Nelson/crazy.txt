I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wondering
What in the world did I do

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
