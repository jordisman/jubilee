There's a bird in the sky 
Flying high, flying high 
To a place from a place 
Changing skies, changing skies 
There are clouds in the sky 
Clouds of fear and despair 
But love like ours never dies 
Changing skies, changing skies 

[guitar]

Little bird have you heard 
Freedom lies, freedom lies 
But love like ours never dies 
Just changing skies, changing skies
