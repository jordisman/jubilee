I'm sittin' in the railway station got a ticket for a destination
On a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band
Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting silently for me

Every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound...

But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound...
