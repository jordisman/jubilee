From the great Atlantic ocean 
To the wide Pacific shore 
To the queen of flowing mountains 
For the hills and by the shore 
She's mighty tall and handsome 
And she's known quite well by all 
She came down from Birmingham 
On the Wabash Cannonball 
Well now listen to the jingle 
To the rumble and the roar 
As she glides along the woodland 
Through the hills and by the shore 
Hear the mighty rush of the engine 
And the lonesome hoboes call 
No changes can be taken 
On the Wabash Cannonball 

[steel]

Now here's to daddy Claxton 
May his name forever stand 
He'll always be remembered 
In the ports throughout the land 
His earthly race is over 
And the curtain round him falls 
We'll carry him home to Glory 
On the Wabash Cannonball 
Well now listen to the jingle 
To the rumble and the roar 
As she glides along the woodland 
Through the hills and by the shore 
Hear the mighty rush of the engine 
And the lonesome hoboes call 
No changes can be taken 
On the Wabash Cannonball 

[guitar]

Well listen to the jingle 
To the rumble and the roar 
As she glides along the woodland 
Through the hills and by the shore 
Hear the mighty rush of the engine 
And the lonesome hoboes call 
No changes can be taken 
On the Wabash Cannonball
