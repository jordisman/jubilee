I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Then come on, oh come on, ooh

Let's get it on, oh baby
Let's get it on, let's love baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, whoa

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give, understand me sugar
Since we got to be here
Let's live, I love you

There's nothin' wrong with me
Lovin' you, baby love, love
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby

(Let me love you)
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be? Oh, oh
(Let me love you)
I'm askin' you baby to get it on with me, oh oh
(Let me love you)
(Let me love you)
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
(Let me love you)
I won't push you baby
(Let me love you)
So come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush, hey

Let's get it on, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on baby, hey, hey
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, ooh, let's get it on baby
This minute, oh yeah let's get it on
Please, let's get it on
I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you baby?
(My body wants some)
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy
(My body wants some)
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna push
I won't push you baby, woo
Come on, come on, come on, come on darling
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Oh, gonna get it on, threatenin' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you
Let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey hey
Girl, you give me good feeling
So good somethin' like sanctified
Oh do right baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me just let yourself go
Oh baby, let's get it on
